    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Emails are a huge part of any job. Whether it be research, corporate or even education, people use this technology to leave messages, some less important than others. Some have argued that emails are to become obsolete in the future, but evidence shows that email is here to stay for the foreseeable future. For example, IMs (instant messengers) might be faster, more wieldy, but there are so many of them out there now that it is difficult to keep track of which contact uses which IM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, a [survey by Adobe](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2019/09/08/if-you-think-email-is-dead--think-again.html#gs.f14pa9) have shown that employees spend a large amount of time on emails. The survey shows that the average email consumer spends about 3 hours a day on work email and 2 hours a day on personal email. 5 hours in a 24 hour day spent on email is definitely significant.\n",
    "<img src='imgs/emailstats.jpg' alt='stats' width='500'/>\n",
    "Granted, a portion of the time is spent on *reading* emails, but the other portion is spent writing them, and people have called writing emails \"stressful\" and \"exhausting\". They fear that writing too short an email reply might convey the wrong message (\"thanks\" or even \"noted with thanks\"), and they then ponder about the best way to go about crafting a reply that would not get them on the bad side of the wrong people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now just imagine how much more productive employees could be if something was to help them write parts of their email!"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "DBS has found that their employees have spent too much time on emails, in his opinion. They would like to implement some infrastructural aids so that employees can be more productive elsewhere. Email writing aids aren't the most novel idea in the world, with textexpander and Google's in-built Smart Compose features. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the top brass at DBS's cybersecurity department have qualms about using third-party software in their infrastructure for security reasons. As a corporation holding loads of sensitive information and data, even the tiniest of risks could lead to a massive breach and leakage of personal information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the data science team has been tasked with building a email writing aid from scratch in the form of a word autocompleter or a text generator and see if it is ultimately worth implementing in their infrastructure."

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explored data collected from the Enron email dataset, which served as the basis for a text generator based in the finance industry. This data was analyzed, cleaned and then preprocessed for usage in modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explored a few models in the journey to pick out the best one. First, we implemented a LSTM RNN model, training it with the base unclean data and established it as a base model. Next, we reran the same model but with the cleaned data. After that, we explored a pre-built transformers model (GPT-2) and finally we looked at a Markov Chains model for comparison. Ultimately, the GPT-2 model outperforms the rest, but there were several interesting quirks about the other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a cost benefit analysis was conducted to see if the model, if implemented, would bring about a sufficiently significant upside."

    "The standard preprocessing methods for NLPs do not all apply to this task. For example, word tokenization might not be effective on a character based text generator while it may work for a word based text generator. Also, lowercasing might not be good as the distinction between words such as Apple (the company) and apple (the fruit) may be lost. This might lead to the meaning of the sentence being lost. However, for some modelling strategies these might be useful, so if required, these steps will be performed in their respective notebooks."

       "      <td>The Southeast RTO orders are out and have followed through with what we exp= ected from the discussion at the FERC meeting. The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to s= atisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000. The Com= mission notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and it= s neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and conf= iguration. The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a la= ck of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they= failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or = what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs. The order s= tates that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmi= ssion organizations reflecting natural markets. The Commission indicates t= hat they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West. Therefore the order requir= es the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discuss= ions as set out in the mediation order. Note that these meetings will star= t next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ. The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope charac= teristics of Order No. 2000. The order finds that Southern's approach to f= ocus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate. The order = states, \"We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the= Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible.\" = The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may b= e more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market develo= pment, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesal= e electricity prices. The order therefore directs the parties to the media= tion as stated above. The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is sta= rting on next Tuesday. It is a lengthier order with more details on other = aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managm= ent, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. University of California, California State University and Enron Reach Settlement Agreement ATTENTION: State, Business editors OAKLAND, Calif., July 11 (AScribe News) -- The University of California, California State University and Enron Energy Services announced today a settlement agreement that will extend their contract for two years and return the two university systems to direct access service from Enron. As part of the agreement, UC and the CSU will drop their lawsuit against Enron and Enron will dismiss its appeal. The two university systems had brought suit in federal court seeking to retain their status as direct access Enron customers after Enron had resourced their power procurement to the Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas&amp;Electric utility companies. \"We are delighted that our negotiations with Enron have ended with retention of the two university systems as direct access Enron customers,\" said Joseph P. Mullinix, UC senior vice president for business and finance. \"The California State University is pleased that we have been able to resolve our differences with Enron and retain our direct access status,\" said Richard P. West, CSU executive vice chancellor and chief financial officer. \"This agreement means considerable savings for the universities and allows us to continue with our energy conservation efforts.\" \"Enron has always been a strong advocate of the benefits of direct access, and we are pleased to be able to extend our contract for two years with UC/CSU,\" said Marty Sunde, vice chairman, Enron Energy Services. \"Separately, with the potential elimination of direct access for California customers, Enron is once again directly serving its commercial customers in California, including UC and CSU. As more and more customers in California see the importance of managing their price risk in power markets, commercial energy users have increased interest in our product offerings.\" The current four-year contract with Enron is scheduled to end on March 31, 2002. The two-year extension, approved in principle, would continue the two university systems as direct access Enron customers until March 31, 2004. Enron and the universities will negotiate price and other terms of the extension between now and Dec. 1, 2001. Both parties have the right to terminate the extension if an agreement is not reached by Dec. 1. The agreement covers all UC campuses and the UC Office of the President, with the exception of UCLA and UC Riverside, which have agreements with their local municipalities. All CSU campuses, except Los Angeles, Northridge, Sacramento and Stanislaus, are part of the Enron contract, as is the CSU Office of the Chancellor. Together, UC and CSU rank as the largest single user of electricity in California. UC's systemwide peak load is 332 megawatts, and CSU's is 117 megawatts. One megawatt powers approximately 1,000 homes. -30- Media Contact: Charles McFadden, University of California, 510-987-9193; charles.mcfadden(at)ucop.edu Colleen Bentley-Adler, California State University, 562-951-4801; Peggy Mahoney, Enron Energy Services, 713-345-7034; pmahoney(at)enron.com AScribe - The Public Interest Newswire / 510-653-9400 $$ APRS0119234206 Copyright ? 2001 Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive LLC.

       "      <td>The Bond Legislation The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts. But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along. The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along. The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal. Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain. No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to \"give it a chance.\" The Core/Noncore Legislative Language The negotiating group continues to work on the language. The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning. Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday. Best, Jeff</td>\n",

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel T= aub Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray= Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electric= ity market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a= misdirected e-mail. The e-mail, containing data on California's power pur= chases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Da= vis spokesman Steve Maviglio.

Real interesting. Worth a look Link to the DWR Contracts. Ban An interesting article too: Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure July 6, 2001 By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said Thursday. Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely would require some future increase. The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a few months to 20 years. The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts would decline over time. Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. \"You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably either average could be defended mathematically,\" said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network. \"We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the contracts are very convoluted and complex.\"</td>\n",

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to s= atisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000. The Com= mission notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and it= s neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and conf= iguration. The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a la= ck of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they= failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or = what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs. The order s= tates that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmi= ssion organizations reflecting natural markets. The Commission indicates t= hat they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West. Therefore the order requir= es the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discuss= ions as set out in the mediation order. Note that these meetings will star= t next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ. The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope charac= teristics of Order No. 2000. The order finds that Southern's approach to f= ocus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate. The order = states, \"We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the= Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible.\" = The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may b= e more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market develo= pment, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesal= e electricity prices. The order therefore directs the parties to the media= tion as stated above. The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is sta= rting on next Tuesday. It is a lengthier order with more details on other = aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managm= ent, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM. Therefore, I am= attaching a summary of the order. One of the important findings of the or= der is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs ar= e making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board. The= refore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and fi= le a compliance filing within 90 days. If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.  \n",

University of California, California State University and Enron Reach Settlement Agreement ATTENTION: State, Business editors OAKLAND, Calif., July 11 (AScribe News) -- The University of California, California State University and Enron Energy Services announced today a settlement agreement that will extend their contract for two years and return the two university systems to direct access service from Enron. As part of the agreement, UC and the CSU will drop their lawsuit against Enron and Enron will dismiss its appeal. The two university systems had brought suit in federal court seeking to retain their status as direct access Enron customers after Enron had resourced their power procurement to the Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas&Electric utility companies. \"We are delighted that our negotiations with Enron have ended with retention of the two university systems as direct access Enron customers,\" said Joseph P. Mullinix, UC senior vice president for business and finance. \"The California State University is pleased that we have been able to resolve our differences with Enron and retain our direct access status,\" said Richard P. West, CSU executive vice chancellor and chief financial officer. \"This agreement means considerable savings for the universities and allows us to continue with our energy conservation efforts.\" \"Enron has always been a strong advocate of the benefits of direct access, and we are pleased to be able to extend our contract for two years with UC/CSU,\" said Marty Sunde, vice chairman, Enron Energy Services. \"Separately, with the potential elimination of direct access for California customers, Enron is once again directly serving its commercial customers in California, including UC and CSU. As more and more customers in California see the importance of managing their price risk in power markets, commercial energy users have increased interest in our product offerings.\" The current four-year contract with Enron is scheduled to end on March 31, 2002. The two-year extension, approved in principle, would continue the two university systems as direct access Enron customers until March 31, 2004. Enron and the universities will negotiate price and other terms of the extension between now and Dec. 1, 2001. Both parties have the right to terminate the extension if an agreement is not reached by Dec. 1. The agreement covers all UC campuses and the UC Office of the President, with the exception of UCLA and UC Riverside, which have agreements with their local municipalities. All CSU campuses, except Los Angeles, Northridge, Sacramento and Stanislaus, are part of the Enron contract, as is the CSU Office of the Chancellor. Together, UC and CSU rank as the largest single user of electricity in California. UC's systemwide peak load is 332 megawatts, and CSU's is 117 megawatts.

But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along. The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along. The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal. Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain. No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to \"give it a chance.\" The Core/Noncore Legislative Language The negotiating group continues to work on the language. The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning. Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday. Best, Jeff  \n",

Real interesting. Worth a look Link to the DWR Contracts. Ban An interesting article too: Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure July 6, 2001 By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said Thursday. Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely would require some future increase. The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a few months to 20 years. The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts would decline over time. Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. \"You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably either average could be defended mathematically,\" said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network. \"We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the contracts are very convoluted and complex.\"  "

SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to satisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. . Commission notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and its neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and configuration. filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a lack of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; theyfailed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs. order states that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmission organizations reflecting natural markets. Commission indicates that they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West. Therefore the order requires the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discussions as set out in the mediation order. Note that these meetings will start next Tuesday, July before a FERC ALJ. Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope characteristics of Order No. . order finds that Southern's approach to focus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate. order states, \"We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in theSoutheast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible.\" Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may be more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market development, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesale electricity prices. order therefore directs the parties to the mediation as stated above. Grid participants are also directed to the mediation which is starting on next Tuesday. It is a lengthier order with more details on other aspects of RTOs, including Independent requirement, congestion managment, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM. Therefore, I amattaching a summary of the order. One of the important findings of the order is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs are making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board. Therefore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and file a compliance filing within days. If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.\n",

But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along. bill would require a /'s vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along. Conference Senator does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal. Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain. No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though continues to say that he wants to \"give it a chance.\" Core/Noncore Legislative Language negotiating group continues to work on the language. language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Taub Sacramento, California, July (Bloomberg) -- California Governor GrayDavis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity market -- information has been trying to keep secret -- through amisdirected e-mail. e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said spokesman Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters onthe office's press list, he said. is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signedthrough June . state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt. ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said ofthe e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said. According to the e-mail, the state bought , megawatt- hours of electricity for $. million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to light typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $ to $. a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accurate. for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $. a megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloomberg Service. California paid an average of $ on the spot market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than onthe day-ahead market. governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed. =\n",

Real interesting. Worth a look to the DWR Contracts. Ban An interesting article too: Connell: cost twice Davis' figure July , By JOHN HOWARD Orange County Register SACRAMENTO -- average cost of electricity purchased under $ billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by Gov. Davis' administration, state Controller said Thursday. said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $, compared with $ to $ estimated by Davis. stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely would require some future increase. controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a few months to years. administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts would decline over time. Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. \"You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably either average could be defended mathematically,\" said Nettie Hoge of Utility Reform Network. \"We can't tell you whether it's $ or $ - the contracts are very convoluted and complex.\"\n",

       "      <td>All: A more detailed version of CAISO's MD proposal was released on Wednesday. Below I am copying a summary prepared by who covers these matters for IEP. It appears that the CAISO proposal will allow for SC's to go short or long in the R/T market (i.e., final schedules do not need to be balanced). That's good. I think the most material issue at this point is how the forward capacity requirement (ACAP, akin to ICAP) will affect our trading. GAC What is CAISO proposing? First off, there are \"target price\" and \"intra-zonal congestion management\" FERC filings that are apparently almost ready for a drop at FERC. \"comprehensive\" package would build off that. In essencence, CAISO is proposing a capacity market (similar to what IEP proposed at the CPUC \"Procurement OIR\") that has an \"available capacity obligation\" (ACAP) on the load-serving entities (LSEs, aka the utilities and electric service providers). This is the solution to the \"all spot, all the time\" design that was associated with the CPUC's \"mandatory buy/sell\" requirement and failure to provide forward reasonableness guidelines for the utilities. LSEs would be required to show / specify to CAISO the ACAP resources on a month-ahead basis equal to at least % of the coming month's peak demand. ACAP resources can be the LSE's own generation, generation under contract, etc. Failure to procure sufficient ACAP would lead to penalties. Also, CAISO appears to suggest that it would be in the middle of arrangements between a LSE and the capacity supply as it would penalize the supplier for failure to be available, operate as dispatched, etc. That wrinkle seems like it calls for party contracts or some element of complexity that shouldn't necessarily be required. Its not clear from the paper how costs for CAISO-dispatched ACAP resource would be allocated to other SCs, particularly where a LSE contracted for the capacity, but CAISO's running it to cover someone else's short energy schedule? It is not particularly clear how DWR resources fit into the mix (there seems to be a contradictory statement in the paper). However, CAISO is proposing a two-year \"transition\" mechanism where CAISO would provide the ACAP resources (based on their stellar creditworthiness?? or DWR resources??). There could be tension here with the proposals at the CPUC proceeding. Also, it appears that an argument can be made that DWR is a LSE under the terms of AB x. CAISO is also moving toward a forward nodal-based congestion mechanism, similar to the PJM type of design. It is based on a bus network model with simplified modeling of adjacent control areas. Dispatch will be on an optimized basis that on resource constraints (that appears to be dynamic) including transmission capacity changes (increased ATC when ETC rights are freed up, etc.) and generation availability. There will be some degree of node aggregation (in the form of demand locations and trading hubs). It appears that RMR contracts could disappear under this approach, although that is not completely clear. Creation of the forward congestion approach with security based optimization effectively removes the need for the \"balanced schedule\" requirement. Under the proposal, CAISO would make trades happen in realtime through the optimization to the extent not addressed through the forward markets. CAISO calls for the resurrection of a day ahead energy market (FERC has called for that). CAISO says its open to that market being run outside of CAISO, but that the need is for a centralized day ahead energy market that could help shape resource needs. CAISO would have the ability to dispatch identified ACAP resources not already scheduled by the LSE. They speak in terms of a \"residual unit commitment\" requirement ... something akin to the \"long lead time\" proposal under the \"must-offer\" requirement. Their start and min load payment proposal would be continued, subject to loosing it for unavailability or participation in the market. Note that CAISO states they will need to mitigate bids due to \"locational market power\", particularly in relation to congestion. I thought that locational market power was addressed via RMR. This raises the \"black box\" issue if CAISO is going to say on a realtime basis that they have some dynamic problem and only a particular generation asset could address the problem so we're mitigating your bid curve based on some form of proxy pricing mechanism. To some extent, in a nodal system, CAISO could argue that more folks have \"locational market power.\" We'll need to review other markets' treatment of this issue. future of the AS markets is questioned in the paper, and there's the specific suggestion that the replacement reserve market is unnecessary if ACAP is put into place. This is probably the largest hole in the paper, because there's a clear implication that something should happen and presumably CAISO has at least come up with some set of options on the issue (i.e., kill AS, have AS markets but alter products, have one AS product but expect low volume, etc). One element that seemed missing was a discussion of demand response. In many respects that element has been consistently missing in the market, save the extraordinary conservation last summer. There is a suggestion that the ACAP requirement could be addressed by demand response, but presumably that would need to be demand that could be dispatched by CAISO, and those resources are particularly limited under the current CAISO demand-side design. While efforts on interruptible programs has occurred at the CPUC, it is not clear that the two entities are heading in the same direction. It was noted earlier that the ACAP proposal is similar to what IEP (and others) suggested at the CPUC Procurement OIR. Based on a lone comment by a CPUCer during the CAISO media call yesterday, the CPUC is very far behind the curve on these issues, and there is absolutely no coordination on this issue. Given that the same \"solution\" is popping up in both venues, there is a real need to make sure that the two pieces can fit together, while avoiding a bureaucratic paralysis that could happen if a formal attempt to \"coordinate\" the venues is proposed.

       "10183  All: A more detailed version of CAISO's MD proposal was released on Wednesday. Below I am copying a summary prepared by who covers these matters for IEP. It appears that the CAISO proposal will allow for SC's to go short or long in the R/T market (i.e., final schedules do not need to be balanced). That's good. I think the most material issue at this point is how the forward capacity requirement (ACAP, akin to ICAP) will affect our trading. GAC What is CAISO proposing? First off, there are \"target price\" and \"intra-zonal congestion management\" FERC filings that are apparently almost ready for a drop at FERC. \"comprehensive\" package would build off that. In essencence, CAISO is proposing a capacity market (similar to what IEP proposed at the CPUC \"Procurement OIR\") that has an \"available capacity obligation\" (ACAP) on the load-serving entities (LSEs, aka the utilities and electric service providers). This is the solution to the \"all spot, all the time\" design that was associated with the CPUC's \"mandatory buy/sell\" requirement and failure to provide forward reasonableness guidelines for the utilities. LSEs would be required to show / specify to CAISO the ACAP resources on a month-ahead basis equal to at least % of the coming month's peak demand. ACAP resources can be the LSE's own generation, generation under contract, etc. Failure to procure sufficient ACAP would lead to penalties. Also, CAISO appears to suggest that it would be in the middle of arrangements between a LSE and the capacity supply as it would penalize the supplier for failure to be available, operate as dispatched, etc. That wrinkle seems like it calls for party contracts or some element of complexity that shouldn't necessarily be required. Its not clear from the paper how costs for CAISO-dispatched ACAP resource would be allocated to other SCs, particularly where a LSE contracted for the capacity, but CAISO's running it to cover someone else's short energy schedule? It is not particularly clear how DWR resources fit into the mix (there seems to be a contradictory statement in the paper). However, CAISO is proposing a two-year \"transition\" mechanism where CAISO would provide the ACAP resources (based on their stellar creditworthiness?? or DWR resources??). There could be tension here with the proposals at the CPUC proceeding. Also, it appears that an argument can be made that DWR is a LSE under the terms of AB x. CAISO is also moving toward a forward nodal-based congestion mechanism, similar to the PJM type of design. It is based on a bus network model with simplified modeling of adjacent control areas. Dispatch will be on an optimized basis that on resource constraints (that appears to be dynamic) including transmission capacity changes (increased ATC when ETC rights are freed up, etc.) and generation availability. There will be some degree of node aggregation (in the form of demand locations and trading hubs). It appears that RMR contracts could disappear under this approach, although that is not completely clear. Creation of the forward congestion approach with security based optimization effectively removes the need for the \"balanced schedule\" requirement. Under the proposal, CAISO would make trades happen in realtime through the optimization to the extent not addressed through the forward markets. CAISO calls for the resurrection of a day ahead energy market (FERC has called for that). CAISO says its open to that market being run outside of CAISO, but that the need is for a centralized day ahead energy market that could help shape resource needs. CAISO would have the ability to dispatch identified ACAP resources not already scheduled by the LSE. They speak in terms of a \"residual unit commitment\" requirement ... something akin to the \"long lead time\" proposal under the \"must-offer\" requirement. Their start and min load payment proposal would be continued, subject to loosing it for unavailability or participation in the market. Note that CAISO states they will need to mitigate bids due to \"locational market power\", particularly in relation to congestion. I thought that locational market power was addressed via RMR. This raises the \"black box\" issue if CAISO is going to say on a realtime basis that they have some dynamic problem and only a particular generation asset could address the problem so we're mitigating your bid curve based on some form of proxy pricing mechanism. To some extent, in a nodal system, CAISO could argue that more folks have \"locational market power.\" We'll need to review other markets' treatment of this issue. future of the AS markets is questioned in the paper, and there's the specific suggestion that the replacement reserve market is unnecessary if ACAP is put into place. This is probably the largest hole in the paper, because there's a clear implication that something should happen and presumably CAISO has at least come up with some set of options on the issue (i.e., kill AS, have AS markets but alter products, have one AS product but expect low volume, etc). One element that seemed missing was a discussion of demand response. In many respects that element has been consistently missing in the market, save the extraordinary conservation last summer. There is a suggestion that the ACAP requirement could be addressed by demand response, but presumably that would need to be demand that could be dispatched by CAISO, and those resources are particularly limited under the current CAISO demand-side design. While efforts on interruptible programs has occurred at the CPUC, it is not clear that the two entities are heading in the same direction. It was noted earlier that the ACAP proposal is similar to what IEP (and others) suggested at the CPUC Procurement OIR. Based on a lone comment by a CPUCer during the CAISO media call yesterday, the CPUC is very far behind the curve on these issues, and there is absolutely no coordination on this issue. Given that the same \"solution\" is popping up in both venues, there is a real need to make sure that the two pieces can fit together, while avoiding a bureaucratic paralysis that could happen if a formal attempt to \"coordinate\" the venues is proposed.
