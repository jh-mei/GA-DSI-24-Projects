What should we be trading for? What should we be trading away? What cards or events should I have my eye on? Also feel free to use this space to discuss anything MTG Finance related.,Things to look out for this weekend!
"Hello, I thought this would be something of note to MTG Finance folks:

Someone confirmed [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/pu1hmj/i_got_my_innistrad_bundle_a_day_early_and_just/) that their \[\[Kaya, Ghost Haunter\]\] from MID's The List has a single PW symbol in the lower left corner.

This seems to indicate that the Playtest cards in The List will be indistinguishable from the 2019 Convention Playtest cards (which currently sit at a high premium compared to the 2021 Playtest cards, which do not have the PW symbol).

\[\[Puresteel Angel\]\] is the only other Playtest card currently in The List, and I would expect the 2019 pricing for these two to drop if there's truly no way to distinguish them from The List.

Thank you!",Playtest cards in The List have a single PW symbol in the lower left
"I know there was an earlier thread about the basic land differences of Japanese and American printers already but I found that the Collector Booster non-foil midnight treatment differences are [even worse](https://youtu.be/AtCvU4qBfqs) and also the fact that both Collector and Draft are printed in the States.   


Put this on top of the Japanese 'versions' of the same prints, we have effective 3 'variant printings'... of a variant.",Printing inconsistency not just between JPN and US printers - certain Collector Booster US prints are also different from Draft Boosters.
"They're looking to dip their feet before they dive in headfirst. I'm helping them run drafts, commander, and a few other events while they decide if card games make sense at their venue. Anyone know of a good place to get boxes?",What's the best place to buy standard boxes? I'm helping a local arcade start events and they don't have a distributor set up.
"Feel this pain :: here is a sell order of mine from card kingdom in July 2014. 5.25 for a wheel of fortune (now being sold for 279.99 @ ""G"". The one that hurt the most was i sold my Lions eye diamond this same year for 52.00 bucks on EBAY. (now 699.99 for NM, and i never played that card, i was like this card is stupid). Im sure i got other good stuff for that money, but doubt its gone up that much,  i still have 1 NM wheel of fortune in the catacombs.

"We are headed for a downtrend.

&amp;#x200B;

The next wave of buyouts will be at much higher prices. What was once possible to do with $625 (buying 2,500 reserved list quarter garbage rares) will now cost $25,000. 

The same math applies to buyouts across all Reserved List buyout targets. Even at lower quantities available for sale, inflated prices increase the absolute dollar amounts needed to both make the acquisitions then hold them for a longer enough period to flip for returns. 

For mid to low end buyouts the new golden number needed will be about $20,000 and for high end buyouts it will exceed $100,000 at current price levels. This is unsustainable. 

There is absolute supply of money in the world, even if the ""money printer go burr"" fetishists believe money will grow infinitely forever, that does not equate to infinite money available now. Using a theoretical hypothesis that a Federal Reserve Bank could print an unlimited supply of currency under specific conditions is a poor thought experiment to justify current reserved list prices.

The current upswing in buyout activity was largely triggered by stimulus and unemployment benefits paid for workers to stay home during the pandemic. It depends on the state but in essence, a minimum wage workers ($20k - $35k/year) can stay home and make up to $65k from unemployment and work an under the table or gig job from a variety of source like Fiverr, Upwork, Uber, Lyft, local construction... declaring no SS# or other means to avoid reporting and in the process making another 25k +. There is a large chunk of the minimum wage workforce making at around $100,000. It will take time for these workers to reenter the workforce as they will seek higher wage jobs and largely will not find them. 

The acceptance of lower wage work will hit the ability of most lower end workers in the economy. This will appear in indices as wage deflation and could spark a deflationary spiral, that's why the Federal Reserve has repeatedly warned about DEFLANATION PRESSURE over the medium term. 

Magic the Gathering has been buoyed by people staying at home playing the game online via webcam, MTGO, Arena, and in small play groups. Returning to work will reduce the overall hours spent playing the game and overall demand for Reserved list staples. We are seeing lower sales of new sets, less excitement, fewer mentions, and overall less engagement which will be the start of the cyclical trend. This will reduce the prices of peripheral reserved list rares that have specific usage in limited decks which will reduce sales and spur price reductions EVENTUALLY.

Price memory will stick in the minds of sellers that anticipates ever increasing prices and this will create a reluctance to mark cards to market which will create a disconnect between asking price and selling price for many of the higher price cards.

The cyclical downtrend will likely continue with the pace of the medium term price deflation as freight prices will fall in 2022 as well. The inflationary pressures of late 2021 and early 2022 will be met with deflationary pressures in the later half of 2022. There are enough liquid MTG investors that want to try to weather the storm so it is unlikely significant quantities will be available for sale at one time and the cyclical downtrend may take several years to flush out. There will be blips up while this process takes place.",Cyclical Downtrend in the MTG Market
"I decided I was going to drop the money finally on ""foiling"" my fetches. I wanted to start with the older ones so went browsing. I tend to lean towards promos, or japanese foils. 

I had no luck finding a playset of flooded strands in JP foil from onslaught, (for any reasonable price that is). I decided on getting a set of foil strands from Zendikar Rising Expeditions. The regular Expeditions were too pricey. Nearly double, sometimes triple in cost.

I shopped via Tcgplayer, and found 2 for 75 in foil, and two for 85 in foil, which was acceptable for me, the only problem was that I had to place two different orders from different shops. I picked up the two more expensive ones and had to wait til next payday to get the other two.

Yesterday I got them in the mail but theres an issue, because it's not what I ordered. These two are regular Zendikar Expeditions.  In foil. The ones that are nearly three times as expensive. I dont know who made what mistake but it was forsure made. I only paid 170 and tax for two of the regular Expeditions. The shop is rather well known. What do I do in this situation. Do I just take my victory? Should I contact them and turn them back in? Part of me wants to in hope that they will exchange them for a matching set and give me some store credit in return but i also have a feeling that they may give me nothing if i did turn them in.

What would you do in this situation? I'm unsure how to handle it.",Shop sends me 500$ in cards for 175$

"https://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/standard#paper

One of the many things that stands out to me when looking at current Standard results is the fact that [[Lair Of The Hydra]] is in roughly 35% of all decks being played. Gruul Werewolves, Monogreen Aggro, Selesnya Ramp, Selesnya Midrange, Gruul Aggro and Jund Aggro and more are all playing it to various extents. Granted, Monogreen Aggro often eschews it for [[Faceless Haven]] (some play both, there's no concensus) so it's not an automatic include in every Green deck but anyone clicking through the decks can see that it's as ubiquitous as a card can get. 

I know that paper Standard doesn't drive prices like it used to but I also don't see the card falling off anytime soon and anything that played in ~33% of decks is going to experience some significant growth. 

In terms of versions I don't think it really matters but I personally snagged a small brick of regular ""plain Jane"" copies and of the nonfoil DnD showcases. Whether I sell or buylist them is irrelevant because I don't see a world where I lose money either way. It's a very low risk, low effort spec in that sense.",Lair of the Hydra is in ~35% of Standard Decks According to Goldfish
Noticed that [[Viridian Revel]] spiked from $0.25 to $4.00.  Probably a good defense against treasure/food/clue tokens that are so popular these days.  Someone on eBay is selling 18 playsets @ $16.15/each so congrats to them on a successful spec!,[SCD] Viridian Revel Spiking
"On Amazon there are two main options presented when you search for commander legends draft boosters.

I noticed this about thirty minutes ago and on Amazon there was a low stock warning saying there is only 18 in stock. By the time of posting the stock count is at 11. So people seem to be deliberately buying a more expensive box from a 3rd party seller with a small amount reviews for the product.

"For context, he hasn't played in probably 7-8 years but got 500 common &amp; uncommons + 10 rares from a game shop for 10 bucks years back and added about 100 cards since then (pretty much all commons and uncommons from the looks). I want to play commander with my friends and I felt it would be a good starting point, but scanning them on TCG (which took forever) gave me a total of 168 usd worth, granted a lot of these are duplicates and/or 50 cents or less, but I still think it would be nice to make an offer to start off a collection. I just don't want to rip him off.

The most notable cards are 2x Heritage Druid (10usd ea.), 1x Natures Lore (6usd), 2x Fyndhorn Elves (4usd ea.) 1x Night soil (3usd) 4x Natures Harvest (2.6usd ea.) and all the other cards are less than 2.5 usd.  -- Also feels important to note that I wouldn't even be using most of these cards since a lot are dupes and I want to play commander.",How much to offer for my brothers magic collection.

Can anyone help point me in the right direction?",How to mint cards?
"Hi, I was wondering if I could get some feedback on something. I am almost afraid to post, the magic community has an extremely wide spectrum of opinionated people. In any case, I have been working on creating high quality replicas of uncut sheets. The real ones would just be way to much money, or simply to rare, like there are probably only less than 10 in the world for Alpha and Beta (assuming). In any case, I have been working on the project for a few years. I finally got my first version of the Beta, Rare uncut sheet, and it looks frieken awesome. I personally love it when I see it every morning, or like I even brush my teeth at night and stare at it. My question for the community is, I wanted to gauge if anyone else was interested in having one of these for themselves. It brings me happiness, perhaps it can do the same for other people. It also has the potential to help bring more exposure to the game of Magic, as it is a piece of artwork, a talking piece that is always on display, people ask about it, it is a talking point at a minimum. Even people who dont know what Magic is, stare and love this thing. I have pictures of it on [uncutsheet.art](https://uncutsheet.art).",feedback for replica Beta uncut sheet
"It's not news that supply chains are in turmoil right now. For background, I am a Sales Executive that specializes in economic research for US based major financial institutions, hedge funds, etc.

As I talk to experts all day the message is the same. This holiday is going to take people by surprise. Shelves of toys, electronics, collectibles, etc are going to empty out quickly and in many cases not refill till after January 1.

They also frequently discuss supply limitations. Ex. Target may normally receive 60,000 various Lego each month. Now, and through the rest of this year they may receive only 20,000.

I am wondering what everyone's thoughts are on his this might affect MTG production. Could we see Crimson Vows production get cut and thus result in higher than expected resale prices due to limited supply? This would also affect any existing set that's continuing to get printed. It's possible, or even likely, that they would cut resource allocation from older sets and put it into producing larger quantities of the new sets. Their is also a global ink shortage that many aren't aware of. I could see a spike across the board on popular cards from sets like MH2 if production slows.",Thoughts on supply chain holiday shock.

Do you see the value of these going down like average when a set releases, or just climbing from where they are now?  I'd like to secure a playset of the extended art editions, but I'm hesitating pulling the trigger now if they're due for the normal 'just released and everyone is selling' price drop.

"Figured I’d post this in here as a reminder that this change is coming. Many places that allow you to sell cards to them for cash tend to give you the option of PayPal and next year I’m guessing PayPal will either block your ability to receive funds or maybe prevent transfer to your bank account without a tax ID on file.  Getting a check is always an option if you don’t want to give your SSN out but it’s unclear if places like SCG, CK, etc will also start asking for SSN (SCG does if you place at events and want cash).

This matches the expected changes with TCGPlayer, eBay and others. Personally I’m probably just going to stop selling stuff because I really don’t trust many of these places to handle my SSN safely.

"In addition to eBay and TCGPlayer, when if comes to MTG most all of us have bought from and/or sold to one or more of what I'd consider ""the big five"" vendors, namely Card Kingdom, ABU Games, Star City Games, Channel Fireball and Cool Stuff Inc.  I'm always interested though to hear about folks' positive experiences when dealing with other lesser known vendors, to broaden the range of those I use - aside from eBay and TCG Player - for my MTG purchases.  

I'll start by detailing a few.  Of course, YMMV, especially with respect to whether taxes might apply plus what your areas of focus are, as mine is mainly older sealed and foils, less so P9 or newer stuff:

**Collector's Cache** \- Very reasonable prices; decent selection, including preorders and foreign; very fast order processing; great email communication; superb packaging of booster boxes; no tax

**CCG House** \- Prices aren't amazing, but they're 100% honest, as I've pulled dual lands from their loose packs of Revised and foil rares from their 7th edition ones

**Graded Power** \- Superb selection and, for boosters, sometimes very competitive pricing; no tax

**Wasteland Gaming** \- Pricing isn't superb, but singles condition is always top notch, including foils

**GameNerdz** \- The offer very early preorders with pricing that, in my experience, they'll lower if the market changes between when you preorder and when it actually releases; no tax

"I got into Magic about a decade ago as a frugal college student and eventually learned to buy boxes and resell money-cards to fund my hobby. I learned a lot and became better at selling and shipping practices over time, but tracking shipments was always tricky because options at the time cut into my ability to break even so I just had to do without and pray I didn't run into too many dishonest buyers.

That said I took a break for a few years and upon my return late last year I found that Ebay had started a program for shipping cards with tracking and insurance that is quite affordable. While it looks like it had a rocky start at first I have been using it since Kaldheim and no complaints so far, except one. While most of the cards I sell are well within the $20 limit I just pulled a Foil Showcase Arlinn, the Pack's Hope which I think is safe to say is going to go for more than $20.

I've grown to really love the peace of mind that tracking gives me for my shipments so I'd like to do that if possible, but USPS seems to either only offer tracking on ""real packages"" or charge a lot through other means. Looking at various options it looks like requesting free flat rate bubbled ""envelopes"" which are admittedly oversized for my needs and then pay for tracking to be the most affordable option but seems rather silly to ship a single card in packaging that could easily hold a college textbook. There has to be a better way than this, but checking here and elsewhere I'm struggling to find a better alternative.

To those who have been doing this longer than I or who have more experience with selling cards over $20, what would you recommend? I'm probably safe if the buyer through Ebay is trusted so maybe I should just eschew tracking but I know I'll stress over it for at least a week or two without delivery confirmation(a personal problem, I know).",Recommendations for how to ship more expensive cards safely and cheaply?

I am curious if there is some reason for this particular Promo Pack card to be commanding this premium. Are people falling in love with that foil planeswalker symbol? Full disclosure, I own numerous Showcase frame foil and non-foil Toskis for EDH (I cannot imagine many green decks where I would not want to play it), and am curious what’s up with the Promo pack out pricing the Showcase.","SCD Toski, Bearer of Secrets"

So... what would YOU do?

How many boxes or cases of each set would you invest in?  How would you go about getting singles?  Would you invest in older sets at all?

"Hey everyone,

Apologies if this topic has been done to death. I did try searching through the backlog of posts here and couldn't specifically find the answer I was looking for.

So I know the conventional wisdom is that for playable cards, singles are the way to go. This is especially true in my case, where format-wise I stick to Commander. Leave the pack-cracking for folks who like to do stuff like draft or really get thrills from the gambling aspect. 

However, I adore the Innistrad extended art, especially the lands. If I intend to have full sets of playable Eternal Night lands for the three colors I most play (Blue/Red/Black) and some extended art/showcase cards for my Commander decks, am I still better off buying all those things in singles? Or is there a tipping point where Sealed Product provides some unexpected value to access some of the art?",Extended Art and Sealed Product for Innistrad

"I was thinking about investing more into magic cards both as a fan and as a way to grow financially, and while I don't know everything about magic, I do play magic with friends occassionally. The reason I mention that is I was thinking of buying a box of each type (set-draft-collector) for the next few sets (and hopefully further), and sleeving the valuable singles to lock in a safe and let sit a few years.


I know that opening packs is easily the least financially reasonable way to invest in magic because packs typically don't turn a profit, however, I love opening packs of cards! The new card smell, the gamble of the draw, and the cards you get that have no/little value can still be used for fun friendly games of magic.


So I was thinking I'd like to make a pack opening YouTube channel or Twitch channel (I haven't made anything yet) where I open packs of cards for other people to also enjoy, I think this will possibly compensate for some of the inherit value loss I expect from opening boxes as opposed to buying singles. Even if this isn't the case it may be something people will enjoy watching just to satisfy the dopamine of the nice rare or foil pulls, and I'd still have a channel as an outlet to do what I would deeply enjoy doing!

And all of this was a long-winded way for me to get advice, if you enjoy watching people pop packs, what are some of the things you enjoy? I know some people show an initial cost and a price per hit to show a general value scale, maybe that's something I should have as well, but at the same time I personally don't enjoy those. I think they get your hopes up when you see everyone gain value of pulls when you typically don't.

Please let me know your thoughts, any advice and criticism is appreciated. Maybe I just need someone to say ""This is stupid and you shouldn't waste your time"" What do you think?","Dear people who enjoy watching pack openings,"

"Currently specing on \[\[Otherworldly Gaze\]\] (picked up \~250 copies @ $0.15 CAD each, as well as some foils) as I think it's seriously under rated, with people comparing it to stuff like \[\[Dream Twist\]\] and \[\[Index\]\] when it's more on the level of \[\[Ponder\]\] and \[\[Faithless Looting\]\]. While I don't see this being a $8-10 common, it's a reasonable thought that it'll hit the \~$0.75-$1 range pretty easily if there's a good pioneer/modern/pauper place for it, which I think there is for several reasons.  


In comparing it to Ponder;  
Upsides;  
1. if you see only one/two you want, you can get rid the other one/two without a fetch/etc and never draw them  
2. Gets value in decks that want cards in the gy (ie. phoenix style decks, possibly storm, etc)  
3. Instant so you can hold up mana t1 (useful w/ fluster, pierce, etc) or respond to triggers/etc (ie. delver)  
4. Late game it flashes back generating more value  
5. Immune to discard spells because of flashback  
6. Sees six cards vs a max of 4 with ponder (shuffle + draw)  


Downsides vs Ponder:  
1. Doesn't draw  
2. Heavier mana investment w/ flashback (4 cards, 1 mana vs 6 cards, 3 mana)  


Comparing to Faithless Looting;  
Upsides;  
1. More card selection for less mana (digs an overall two deeper for 1 less)   
2. Instant speed  


Downsides;  
1. Doesn't draw  
2. Not a discard outlet  


I think there's a few decks that want this over cards like \[\[serum visions\]\], mostly combo decks or Phoenix builds, some control style tempo decks may also find use of this card.   


It also seems to be super under evaluated by many people who haven't even considered playing with the card, especially in a Phoenix deck where it really does get a ridiculous amount of value. Even more so in pioneer over the two mana cantrips like \[\[strategic planning\]\] and potentially \[\[expressive iteration\]\]. It might even be better than \[\[chart a course\]\] in the deck, given that it lets you hold up removal on op's turn and EOT set up your draws/cantrip chain. It's also something you don't mind pitching to \[\[lightning axe\]\] or \[\[izzet charm\]\] as with the flashback you're only down half a card in a situation where you might otherwise be discarding something useful. Having an additional way to potentially flip \[\[Thing in the Ice\]\] at instant speed is also nice, given that I'm slotting this in a Pioneer Pheonix deck over planning, which both saves on mana and digs deeper.",[SPEC] Otherworldly Gaze

"Amazon Canada has implemented a new rule for sellers. 95% of our shipments must have a valid tracking number. This is ridiculous for a number of reasons:

1. Tracked shipping in Canada costs anywhere from 8$-15$ depending on where its going. Most of our sales are items in the 1$-5$ range. Even if there was an exemption for small orders, paying 15$ tracking is simply not doable on orders under 100$ or so.
2. Buy shipping doesn't work for CA sellers (It's just broken).
3. When shipping an item, there is no option given to enter 'untracked envelope'.
4. The policies are extremely unclear about what Amazon is expecting of secondary market sellers. They already enforce pricing checks, which makes absolutely no sense, we always lose any sort of claim if the package isn't tracked, and there has been a lack of ASINs starting from around Strixhaven (so we're not able to list new sets). Not to mention they will take down listings with names like 'beetle' or 'sword' because they get flagged as 'insecticide' or 'weapons'. Seller help is just an automated system asking for barcodes to prove we can sell certain items.

Not to mention that a US buyer can 'return' an item under 20$ and get 'returnless refund' which people have discovered means 'free cards under 20$'.

"Hi,
so, a seller from MKM sent me 2 cards, one was fine but the other has a more than evident pressure mark on the lower corner

https://ibb.co/f8RJh1M

I'm fairly new to MTG but this I think would be considered damaged, not EX.
Shipment was standard (no Trustee) but the cards were packaged correctly, there were two forests cards placed around them and those are not damaged so shipping damage is out of question.

When asked about it,the seller didn't even apologize for the inconvinience and just told me to send it back and he'll refund the shipment and card cost once he'll receive it.

Problem is the card in NM/EX condition is only worth 3€, in this condition I don't think you can even get back the price of the eventual shipping cost to send it back to him...this make no sense.

I replied that I want a full refund in exchange of a good review (I value profesionalism and I think it's a fair offer), I'm not going to give a good review if I don't get my money back without hassles.

He's yet to reply, but if he really want it back anyway (but why would he?!?!) I'm going to request that he first refunds card and shipment before I send it to him, I'm the damaged part in this situation and he already has my money so I won't put at risk any more of my money/time for seller's mistake.

"Historically foil versions of cards were always worth more than nonfoils, partly due to the bling factor but more so because of the comparative scarcity/cost.

Looking at Double Masters Box Toppers, there are 40 in the set, such that assuming perfect collation it would take 20 booster boxes to accumulate the nonfoil set and 20 VIP packs to accumulate the foil set.  At $500-550 per box for the booster boxes, that's $10000-11000 for the nonfoil set, while at $125-150 per VIP pack that's only $2500-$3000 of VIP packs for the foil set, although it probably would take more given the mythic collation issue with the VIP packs.  But even accounting for that, there would be  a huge difference.  Yet as of now the foil versions are still worth more than the nonfoil counterparts - not a ton more, but more, with the gap closing.

Do folks think it's inevitable that the nonfoils will surpass the foil versions in price?  If so, by how much?

"I have realised a good number of old-frame foils (Masques block, Onslaught block, Urza's Legacy) jumped way up in price over the past few years (King Crab foil is 80 euro, really?!), to the point I'm wondering if I should lock in profits and plan to repurchase whatever I sell after a reprint.

One the other hand, looking at foil Prophecy Spore Frog, the single reprint (so far) only dropped the price by about 10%.

Kind of wondering what other people are doing, if they're selling out or holding, and why.  The cards I'm looking at in my collection are almost all single copies, so if I sell it that's it, I don't have another.  They were all purchased initially for either a specific EDH deck (i.e. foil Empress Galina for a Thassa sea-themed deck) or just because I like the card.

So far I'm leaning towards hold as the Spore Frog example shows buying back into them is dicey as we have no idea when any card will be reprinted and the price drop might be barely significant.

Thoughts?",Old-frame foils
"Hi there. 

So recently I found a Chains of Mephistopheles listed at a very good price, purchased it and it arrived in a graded Beckett Slab, Which was unexpected. 

The Grading was 7.5 - with bad scores on corners and edges (7 and 7,5) but 8 and 9 respectively on surface and centering. 

So I want to ask, besides ensuring that the card is authentic (even then apparently there's fake slabs out there) does grades like these actually add to the value of the card? 

Is there a trend that recommends older cards to be Graded? Or is this more of a Authenticity thing?  

Would buyers prefer graded cards?  Would grading actual translate to better selling price? 

Also, I see that graders provide population number for the cards graded, how does this effect Value of the card? 

Many thanks.",How much Value does grading add to a card?
"It's not discussed here a lot, but many of us are subscribed to The Command Zone's patreon for early access to their videos. Personally, I loathe commander, but I've never hated it enough to leave money on the table. 

Early access to The Command Zone episodes has been an easy way to make money for years now. However, given the recent Golos ban, I'm worried that the tides are shifting.

"I posted here a couple days ago and the mods removed it. The situation looks much more dire than previously disclosed. Financials of future trade shows in 2021 put many of them in doubt.

The first national trade show for collectibles was Flesh &amp; Blood this last weekend. It was booked in the Las Vegas Convention Center which has a 150,000 person capacity. 750 registered attendees (backpack sellers + players) showed up according to their twitter feed. The price was reduced from $49.99 to 0 as in FREE. I pulled internet data for both at the bottom. 

CES pays millions to use the same facility at the convention center. Significant mistakes were made and this has been defined as a ""success"". This is how you ""success"" yourself into living under a bridge, pissing into a soup can to add flavor to your hobo soup.

That's a huge swing in attendance. There are serious questions about what trade shows are going to look like. Channel Fireball hosted the event, the costs for hosting and trade shows are broken down below. The actual event appears to have been scaled down to take place in one of the cafeteria's used for CES when it is hosted in the same venue. 

To host an event at the Convention Center, the facility requires a $100,000 minimum fee.

Hosting cost

$100,000 minimum

$2-10 per head for traffic count - for this event they would be rolled into the hosting cost.

Fixed % of booth revenues

Taxes and Usage Taxes 

&amp;#x200B;

Vendor Booth Costs - 

$1,200 - $1,500 per day per standard stall non premium space

$4,500 base rate for back of the room space

Shipping (limited routes and vendors) - Rates are very high now

Handling (Freeman) - (Variable based on intake but not to be less than $2lb + storage per hour/day) 

Cleaning + Facilities - this may be lumped into the minimum cost

&amp;#x200B;

Claims were made that CFB brought in 21 people to work the show and had a 20' x 20' premium booth. Costs are as follows for 21 people. The sponsor of the event usually books the revenue for the booths so in effect their booth cost is 1/2 of the booth fee because they pay it to themselves then have a revenue split with the facility.

 

Facilities including carpeting, cleaning, trash, power - $2,500 - $3,000

Booth Rental Fee based on a 20 x 20 premium booth for 3 days - $21,000 

Storage, intake, shipping, freight handling, cartage for booth and material - $5,500

Airfare for 20 \~$8,000 - $10,000

Lodging based on shared accommodations and best rates \~ $6,000

Per diem, food, incidentals for employees - $4,000 - $6,000

&amp;#x200B;

CFB may have been able to work a discount but the revenue from this show is low, less than $10,000 and costs well exceed $100,000.

It is difficult to see many other sponsors want to take a shot in the current environment.

&amp;#x200B;

The base rate for booths in non premium space starts at an advance booking rate of $1,200 - $1,500 per day per stall. So a 3 day booth  in the back of a show in a bad location costs $4,500 for space rental + cleaning fees + shipping for materials + handling + electrical + +. This is why many vendors try to use communal trash cans, ""borrow"" power from other booths, and go to Walmart to buy display racks they throw away instead of renting as it saves as much as 90%.

"Hey guys, so I've been looking into it and I feel like a EV tool for set booster boxes is JUST out of my reach;  


So far, I have:  
|Land Slot| - 1   
(85% normal, 15% foil)  
|Commons/Uncommons| - 6   
(5C/1U) - 35%  
(4C/2U) - 40%  
(3C/3U) - 12.5%  
(2C/4U) - 7%  
(1C/5U) - 3.5%  
(0C/6U) - 2%  
|Alt Art/Fancy Slot| - 1  
(1C) - 50%  
(1U) - 50%  
(Note - I couldn't find any data pertaining to the odds of this slot being common or uncommon, just that it will be one or the other, so I am making a big assumption here)  
|Wild Card Slot| - 2  
(2C)       - 49%  
(1C/1U) - 24.5%  
(2C/1R) - 17.5%  
(2U)      - 3.1%  
(1U/1R) - 4.3%  
(2R)       - 1.6%  
|Rare/Mythic Slot| - 1  
(1R)  - 86.5%  
(1M) - 13.5%  
|Foil Slot| - 1  
(1C) - 71.4%  
(1U) - 21.4%  
(1R) - 6.2%  
(1M) - 1%  
|Tip/Token/""The List""|  
Trash - 75%  
List - 25%  
For the list, I assume the chances of pulling a card of any particular rarity from the list are probably similar to the of pulling one in the foil slot, and the chances of it being foil are the same, though it could be based on the percentages of the list cards that are common, uncommon, rare, and mythic, which would take some calculations based on what the current rates are (for example if there are 125 commons, 100 uncommons, 55 rares, and 20 mythics, then it would be C - 41.67%, U - 33.33%, R - 18.33%, and M - 6.67%; if anyone has further information on this, I welcome the input!  


From there, I would average out the values of all the cards that could end up in each slot, multiply that by the odds of that outcome (for example, Strixhaven commons are currenly at an average of $0.21 and Uncommons are at $0.42, so for the commons slot, it would be the equation (C\*A)+(U\*B)=D\*E=F, where C&amp;U are the average values of commons, A&amp;B being the number of commons and commons, D being the total value if you were to get that outcome, E being the chances of that outcome happening, and F being the value added to that slot by that potential outcome; so (.21\*5)+(.42\*1)=1.47\*.35=$0.5145, then (.21\*4)+(.42\*2)=1.68\*.4=$0.672. I'll save you the rest of the math, but for Strixhaven the EV of the slot is $1.70. From here I'm sure you can apply these concepts to the other slots.  


The big issue I'm hitting up against is I don't want this to have to be manually figured out every time I want to check the EV of a set box, but I haven't done programming in almost a decade and remember almost none of it, and I have never worked it API's before (was thinking that TCGPlayer would be good to use). Furthermore, ""The List"" presents a bit of a problem, as every set that comes out changes what cards are available, and I can't find any price or EV tracking website for the list that doesn't just clump them all together  


In the end, I feel like whatever tool was created would take a little bit of work to modify the list of calls to the TCGPlayer prices, but not too much. Either way, does this seem reasonable/doable? Any tech nerds feel like doing a project?",Set Boosters EV tool (concept)/assistance request maybe?

In the statement they said that they want to make 8 and 9 mana spells relevant in commander and that \[\[biorhytm\]\] and \[\[coaliton victory\]\] are apparently too easy to setup. So as a spec this makes them rather unprobable (though not impossible as some will likely point out)

  
***HOWEVER***

  
They didn't mention \[\[Sway of the Stars\]\] in the statement as ""too easy to assemble"" and it also checks a lot of boxes mentioned in reasoning behind worldfire unban noticabyl:

1. big mana spell goes boom
2. requires a bit more effort to pull off since you need to finish the players from that 7 hp
3. there are similar cheaper effects in the format (like the worldfire which deletes almost everything and sets life totals to low number or \[\[worldpurge\]\] that resets boards and hands to 7 cards in hand)

Another thing about it like the world fire is that it has only had 1 pritning back in the betrayers of kamigawa which may make cards in good quality that much more desirable.

"Taking my first look at Innistrad: Midnight Hunt mythics.  Here are my takes of various temperatures, sorted by highest to lowest average price on MTG stocks.

* \[\[Teferi, Who Slows the Sunset\]\] looks incredibly bland at 4 mana.  The untap ability looks like 5 mana Teferi's ability at a glance, but it's way worse.  Only untapping one land and not drawing a card makes it far less useful to defend yourself with.  I'm reminded a lot of the original Dovin planeswalker that occasionally saw play if you were already in those colors.  It's certainly not strong enough to pull someone into those colors.  Price should go way down.
* \[\[The Meathook Massacre\]\] looks like a fused card where you always get most of a blood artist for BB and can get a sweeper for whatever you dump into X.  Useful if you want the drain ability, likely too mana intensive for just the sweeper.  Probably has a home in most Aristocrat EDH decks or decks that might consider Blood Artist as a combo card.  Price will probably go down some, but there will be demand for this one.
* \[\[Arlin, the Pack's Hope\]\] feels like a very slightly powered down Gideon, Ally of Zendikar.  Making two 2/2 tokens is very strong, and the back side hits for a lot of damage.  I'd be surprised if any Gruul or red-green-x decks didn't consider this in Standard.  It's not out of the realm of possibilities in traditional (non-Lurrus) Jund in Modern.  It's pretty meh in EDH, but the werewolf theme will probably bolster the numbers somewhat.  The price probably drops initially due to the supply dump at release, but I think this will do alright afterword.
* \[\[Moonveil Regent\]\] Standard might want this for the body and the chance to draw a couple cards.  Commander multicolor decks probably want this to live the dream, but I don't think that's a particularly popular theme.  I expect the price on this one to drop fairly hard.
* \[\[Lier, Disciple of the Drowned\]\] ~~Deleted lots of words~~  Wait, you can't counter spells either.  Who wants this?  I guess an EDH deck that cares about flashback and completely want to skip counterspells might be interested.  Pretty sure the price on this drops like a rock.
* \[\[Lord of the Forsaken\]\] looks a lot like Lier, but it's got a little potential for more.  Coverting life into mana is powerful, though the 6cmc price tag means that colored mana will be scarce unless it survives a turn.  This will have medium EDH demand in decks that care about casting graveyard spells or self mill/aristocrats decks.  Not sure where the home is in any 60 card format.
* \[\[Bloodthirsty Adversary\]\] in Standard is a 2/2 haste for 2.  You can probably chart Robber of the Rich almost exactly.  They both had the same important stat line and a little situational value.  Bloodthirsty Adversary will probably do a tiny bit better in older formats, simply because creature type Vampire is more popular.
* \[\[Sigardian Savior\]\] is the Revillark ability for one less mana (and you keep the creature).  There is some combo potential with this, but a lot of it had already been explored due to the aforementioned Revillark.  Useful for decks that self mill and plan to recur combo pieces.  You can get this effect for less mana in Modern, so it's really Standard or EDH only.  Price is definitely going down after supply hits, recovery will depend on the demand from EDH over time or something degenerate in Standard (if paper play picks up).  Does the creature type Angel add anything extra these days?
* \[\[Sigarda, Champion of the Light\]\] Useful only if your standard Selesnya aggro deck wants a random beater (and can't play Arlin, the Pack's Hope), or if your EDH humans deck wants a card with some text on it.  The price should drop like a rock
* \[\[Spectral Adversary\]\] Standard play probably requires a blue aggressive deck (unlikely), this doesn't phase anything out that really matters in a control mirror.  Modern Spirits probably wants this due to Aether Vial shenanigans and fitting the overall theme of the deck.  Commander decks are interested if they have a Phasing or Sprits theme or if they want to spend five million mana to protect their board.  I guess Pioneer Spirits is a thing since they got a precon deck, so this might go there as well.  Minimal Modern demand and very low EDH demand probably keeps this price fairly low
* \[\[Tainted Adversary\]\] The numbers all look good here for Standard.  It's somewhere between fine and great for both midrange and aggressive black decks.  It's a little too expensive to get the extra tokens in Modern, and that's probably the most exciting part there.  It's great in EDH if you value the decay zombie tokens.  I've honestly got no idea how useful those will be, so I'm not sure how to judge the card there.  Feels like that will heavily influence the price of the card.  Even if they aren't that good, the creature type alone will keep this at a decent price.
* \[\[Primal Adversary\]\] a 3CMC 4/3 with flood protection is a perfectly fine place to be.  Green has a lot of strong, aggressive creatures for Standard to pick from.  That's not a particularly exciting place to be in Modern or EDH though. 
* \[\[Jerren, Corrupted Bishop\]\] Like several other cards in the set, this has a lot of appealing lines of text on it.  However, it's going to be hard to work with in practice.  Generating non-token humans to sacrifice takes way more work than regular token fodder, so you need a specific Aristocrats engine for this.  Modern might make it work, Standard could make it work.  Commander probably has the most pieces to make this work, but it's not the best payoff to justify the effort.  It combos with Tree of Redemption if you want to get cute.
* \[\[Poppet Stitcher\]\] is a pretty good Spells Matter payoff card, primarily for EDH.  It's comparable to Talrand, Sky Summoner, but it comes down a turn sooner.  The decreased cost forces you to decide if you want your tokens to actually battle or you want the ability to generate more over a turn cycle (and you lose flying in the comparison).  I'd expect this to have some EDH demand.  It's priced cheap enough that you could consider it in Modern, but it's probably losing out to Aria of Flame or Thing in the Ice.  This is probably good enough that it should be a decent hold (after the initial drop)
* \[\[Intrepid Adversary\]\] This has homes in Standard white weenie and Modern Humans.  Modern is the more financially relevant format, and it should slot in there fairly well.  Humans has picked up several 3cmc cards recently, but this is a nice anthem effect to complement Thalia's Lieutenant.  The interaction with Aether Vial is also relevant.  It's probably not holding it's current price tag, but it'll stay out of bulk ranges (unless it's a flop in Modern Humans).  I wouldn't buy at current prices, but I wouldn't feel uncomfortable buying during the release weekend supply dump.  I don't think I'd spec on this, but it's a fine pick up if you need them for your deck
* \[\[Consuming Blob\]\] Tarmogoyf ooze has a home in every Ooze EDH tribal deck.  Supply is going to easily outstrip demand.  Probably not bulk because of the creature type line, but it won't be expensive.  
* \[\[Enduring Angel\]\] will need some EDH demand to pick up a higher price tag.  This acts as a roadblock against aggressive decks, but it's going to die to a stiff breeze long before the ability matters.  Giving you hexproof just means the opponent can't mess up aiming their burn spell.  You can gain 3 life for far less than 5 mana.  Cool concept, but this feels like bulk
* \[\[Sunstreak Phoenix\]\] I don't think day/night is going to break out of standard, but this is a very strong card for a midrange red deck.  A four power recursive flier is no joke, even if the recursion costs a little mana.  The two biggest hits against this are the coming into play tapped (since day/night transition happens at the beginning of the turn) and what appears to be several graveyard exiling effects randomly stapled to cards.  Not a terrible spec if the price craters, but Magic Arena will let us know if this has a standard home before release weekend even happens.  This is too unwieldy outside of Standard.
* \[\[Hostile Hostel\]\] This feels like it shouldn't be the cheapest Mythic in the set.  It's not Westvale Abbey, but it's an untapped, non-legendary land that can turn into a decent creature with protection.  Standard decks can play a copy or two of this card, but it competes with Faceless Haven (in mono colored snow decks), all AFR creature lands, and any other colorless utility lands (like Field of Ruin).  The numbers don't line up for Modern.  EDH Aristocrats decks can certainly take a look at this, though I'm not sure it's worth a slot.  If nothing else, the price will dip with release weekend and is probably a fine pick up at that point.  The silly name probably helps keep this card from being lost to memory longer than it otherwise would.

Overall, I don't think any of these cards are due for a big price spike.  Arlin, the Pack's Hope seems like the strongest card to me, though that is more focused on Standard than I'd like for a financial investment.  The Meathook Massacre is probably another strong contender due to the Aristocrats popularity and combo potential.  It's got demand in the right places too, since EDH is far more likely to carry a card's price tag than Standard is.  Teferi looks incredibly unremarkable and overpriced.  Most of the Adversary cycle looks strong for Standard, and some are playable in Modern (just check the creature type and see if a Modern deck exists).  Tainted Adversary is the only one I'm excited about for EDH at all.  

I didn't read all the rares yet, and I've only skimmed the commons/uncommons.  Thoughts could be wildly off if I'm missing some combo potential.

"Last week PSA announced it was decreasing the price for Express submissions from $200 down to $150 per card. While this cost exceeds the value of most modern cards I think this will be beneficial for those who have been waiting to get high end vintage cards graded. 

Here is the statement from PSA with the link down below:


PRICE DECREASE FOR ‘EXPRESS’ ORDERS

“As our daily capacity continues to grow, we are able to accept more new orders while still committing over 90% of our daily capacity to the backlog. This ability to accept more submissions means we can lower the service fee for Express level submissions from $200 to $150 per card, effective immediately. What’s more, any pending Express orders will be honored with this new price reduction as well. This is a clear victory for collectors as our Complete-Through-Dates (CTDs) for Express level orders are improving and customers can expect to get their Express orders back within 30 days moving forward. We hope to bring back our Regular service level tier sometime in Q4, but that will be contingent upon our continuing ability to expand capacity and integrate improved technology into our process. Stay tuned for further developments on that front.”

"Last year I picked up a bunch of the sealed collector hanger cases for ikoria and eldraine around the time they were being fire sold for ridiculously cheap after walmart, target, etc got rid of their inventory.  I would regularly see a half dozen cases or so on ebay listed for \~$2000 or so for months, and then when Ikoria started to wane and supply dried up, the prices shot up to around $2900 for the last sold listing I saw.  The thing is, I've not seen a single one available since at least 90 days ago, as there are both no live listings for cases of hanger packs, nor sold listings that show up due to ebay's 3 month expiration on visible listings.  TCGplayer doesn't even have a listing, period, for hanger cases of either ikoria or eldraine, I can't find a listing for them on any site.  


Back when I bought the cases, I cracked an entire case of eldraine and ikoria for myself(foolishly, but it did provide some helpful data in the end) and they are basically 10x collector boxes per case since they have the same rate of full art foils etc as the regular boxes, and the eldraine packs have the same ""clumping"" aspect as the regular boxes, every twelve packs.

I guess I'm curious, what would the price of these be nowadays?  People are cracking the cases and selling the individual boosters, but the sealed cases I have seen sold for 2800-2900 multiple times before they disappeared entirely from ebay, which is a good bit more than selling the individual packs.","Factory Sealed Ikoria Collector Hanger Pack Case of 120, what's it worth?"

Buy-in price averages rounded (tax + shipping included): $24 NM $22 LP $20 MP

Combined buyout total: 200+

Personal stake: 74

Logic / Reasoning: 

Actually better than people give it credit for overall.

Strong interaction with upcoming zombie precon commander (Wilhelt).

Zombies are one of the more supported tribes which adds to their popularity.

Reserved list (captain obvious).  Likelihood of losing money is slim.

Extremely strong synergy with sacrifice-type strategies (Vampires anyone?)

Has high potential for widespread popularity, fun factor is certainly there for casuals.

Combo and synergy potentials with new prints is somewhat decent.

Extremely unique and fairly costed effect.

Downsides:

Wording is absolute garbage, 4 out of 5 players will misread it.  

Mirage had a massive print run, natural supply versus demand may not be as imbalanced as one might think.

No real way to know if casuals will be willing to pay $40 to put this in their Wilhelt deck as opposed to $20.  Market demographic has the ability to backfire.

Overall buyout rating: 7/10

Opportunities on relatively low-priced Reserved List with upcoming synergies will continue to become more and more scarce as time moves on, so in my opinion, when they do come along you might as well go for it IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO TIE UP THE CAPITAL.  Don't do this if its a make a break situation, please.

"Hi everyone,

over the past few years I've been getting an increasing amount of ""restored"" cards when buying vintage cards via MKM, especially from professional vendors.

The method is mostly used to conceal slight to medium water damage and bends, which is important in MKM grading guidelines - it will arguably lift the grade from poor/played (damaged/hp) to light played (played) as heat pressed cards are usually tournament legal in sleeves.

On the other hand I believe this treatment is damaging cards even more as it does change the structure of the cardboard. From my experience cards get more stiff and most of the time the surface of cards does get changed/ flattened. So just as inking one might argue this kind of treatment would degrade cards to poor/ damaged.

"Here are mine - I'm going to go through each set, discuss some winner cards and give it a grade and my thoughts on future investment.

***Throne of Eldraine:*** Overall, I thought this was an interesting set. I really liked the ""fairy tale"" theme. This set got a lot of flak because it was a bit overpowered. I would agree criticisms are fair. I thought the set was creative on the whole. Adamant was interesting. I wasn't super thrilled with adventure though - especially since you couldn't interact after you cast the first spell. At first I didn't like ""food tokens"" but they grew on me. The Oko debacle left a sour taste in my mouth (did they not playtest this card??) but some winner cards include \[\[Command Tower\]\], \[\[The Great Henge\]\] and \[\[Embercleave\]\]

I think this is a good investment to hold for sealed. It will be looked back on as a unique set, has many good cards and should age decently.

**Final Grade: 8.4/10**

***Theros Beyond Death:*** I'm a big sucker for Greek/Roman mythology and Ashiok is cool so I was always a big fan of this plane. I thought Escape, Constellation and Devotion were all good mechanics. Good to see Saga cards return as well. I'll admit the indestructible God enchantments irked me at times, especially the overused \[\[Heliod, Sun-Crowned\]\] but other winner cards include \[\[Shadowspear\]\] and the titans. 

Obviously, this set wasn't nearly as powerful as Throne and I think it's a ""decent"" but not great investment for the future. I don't see it aging THAT well but there's enough decent cards to prevent it from being a dud. So cool plane/environment but less impressive inevitability. 

**Final Grade: 8.1/10**

***Ikoria, Lair of the Behemoths:*** I was not a fan of this set at all when it was first released. We just had two ""monster plane"" sets with the dinosaur sets the year before and we're doing behemoths? I felt they should have waited a year or two to unleash this one. I thought the Godzilla crap ruined the fanfare around this set too when it first released.

This set has grown on me a little bit though. Mutate is cool enough, I guess. Keyword counters is cool too (like Menace counter etc). Cycling isn't original but is always a welcome mechanic IMO. One thing I HATED was ""companion"". We already have a similar mechanic in Commander, why bring this into traditional play. Also, how do we know the opponent isn't cheating? Pain in the ass to count my opponent's deck to make sure they adhere to \[\[Yorion, Sky Nomad\]\] stipulations. For winner cards, I liked \[\[Luminous Broddmoth\]\], \[\[Shark Typhoon\]\] (which feels like a meme) and \[\[The Ozolith\]\]. Triomes were also cool.

From a financial point of view, this set is weak. That's why you can buy boxes for cheap. I don't see much nostalgia or future growth here, I wouldn't have a huge position in Ikoria sealed (although maybe the Godzilla cards will take off someday). 

**Final Grade: 6.5/10**

***Zendikar Rising:*** Easily a failure of a set. From a storyline point of view, returning to Zendikar was uneccesary because nothing really happened. Nothing cool/exciting. Bad mechanics too. ""Party"" was dumb and should have been saved for AFR. Kicker again? Boring. Not a fan of the Modal double faced cards that were intoruced - felt it set a bad precedent for MTG. Landfall was a good/cool mechanic though. Not a whole lot of winner cards. I guess \[\[Lithoform Engine\]\]. 

Don't expect there to be any value in this set. It was a dud all around.

**Final Grade: 3.9/10**

***Kaldheim:*** I really liked this set and I know this is unpopular because many people did not like it. I thought having a ""Nordic"" plane/theme was cool and it was nice to see what the Phyrexians were up to. I really liked the return of the Snow Lands. Foretell was really cool and Boast was fine. Interesting to see Poison Counters return too. Winner cards include \[\[Goldspan Dragon\]\] and \[\[Koma, Cosmos Serpent\]\].

Financial-wise, I think this set is underrated. I think it will age well. We also will see Snow cards again at some point and I'm sure there are some hidden cards in this set that have future potential. I'm looking at you \[\[Jorn, God of Winter\]\].

**Final Grade: 8.6/10**

***Strixhaven:*** Cool plane/storyline. Digging the Harry Potter theme. Nice to see Liliana back as Professor Onyx. Mystical Archive was really cool. I did NOT like the modal two-sided cards with a choice of a creature (dean) to play. I feel this runs contrary to MTG spirit. It should be one card, one side UNLESS it's a trigger like Transform. Strixhaven leaned into this in a way that grinded my gears. Learn was ""meh. Seemed interesting on paper but didn't turn out so great. Magecraft is cool. I also didn't like the head of the colleges being ""elder dragons"". It didn't fit with the theme of Strixhaven and we were getting a bunch of Dragons in the next set anyways (AFR) so these elder dragons ended up being a bust. Should have just been powerful wizards or djinns or avatars. A bunch of neat cards but none are super valuable

Overall, a very financially weak set. They way the printed Mystical Archive ensured they would not be very valuable. (Even Demonic Tutor will likely drop). Cool set but don't expect it to age well.

**Final Grade: 7.5/10**

***Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms:*** Most people agree this was a very disappointing set. Lots of iconic cards from Drizzt to the Mindflayer to Tiamat to the Spider Queen. So what happened? Well, I do understand this is a supposed to be a ""Core"" set so this should be kept in mind. Still, WOTC deliberately kept this set weak to balance the upcoming standard? 

For starters, ""venturing into the dungeon"" was done poorly. It just wasn't -fun-. So you get to scry 1 or create a treasure token? It is really difficult to finish one and once you do, the rewards aren't worth it. Dice rolling was very neat though.

I do think it will age better than Strixhaven, Zendikar R. etc because it is ""iconic"" and may be more valuable because of this (think 10-20 years). As of now though and for the near future, no value in this set. Cool cards like Gnawbone etc but disappointing.

"MVP posted its take on increasing prices we are all seeing.  Since the main Magic sub main not understand basic economics (or rather be in denial about it), I am reposting the message here for a more appreciative audience:

&gt; MVP TMYK: Markets, Prices, MSRP's, Gouging/Scalping and the 202x's supply chains
&gt; 
&gt; *Due  to the recent increase in inquiries regarding why prices seem to be  rising everywhere, and why so many new products are either not available  or are only available at prices way above MSRPs ('Manufacturer's  Suggested Retail Price'), we are posting this article to help direct  accounts understand the current state of the Collectibles  industry:*  
&gt;
&gt; In  short, low-priced resellers get outbid by high-priced resellers, simple  as that. Manufacturers generally don't sell to resellers anymore, they  sell direct to the public or to distributors/suppliers, who can price  however they want. Why would a supplier keep pre-committing units to MVP  at a very low cost when other higher-priced resellers are calling them  offering double and triple what MVP offers?  And now take the next  logical step: a reseller who profits, say, $80 off of productA, vs MVP  who profited only $40, well when productB comes around, who do you think  has more money available to offer higher?  And what stops a supplier or  manufacturer from all of sudden deciding not to fill a pre-confirmed  MVP order? 'Oh well, you could just sue them if they did that.'.  Really..? No non-mass market reseller could afford the 6 and 7 figure  costs of time and money of those types of lawsuits, and the suppliers  know it. Thus why there are so few low-priced high-volume resellers that  stay around long in any industry, they eventually just get  outbid/outprofited across the board.  
&gt; Important  note to remember: comparing Collectible prices of release-date-delivered  items to (a month or two later)-delivered-items is not a productive  exercise; there is a clear and defined pool of buyers (its huge..) that  want release-day units to open and use, within a certain range they  don't care what the price is in 3 months. If it helps you can think of  it as a completely different product than the unit that arrives 2 months  later: they aren't the same because fomo and trending hypes etc create  tangible value and thus create product differentiation. The  manufacturers and suppliers know this. Intimately.  
&gt; So,  if you see a manufacturer posting an 'MSRP' of $100 on their website  page, that says Out Of Stock, but you saw at least 4 people on social  media showing screenshots that they got it for $100, then the fact that  the 1000 other sellers online are all posting the unit for $500 must be a  complete and total collusion scam; they're all working together in  unison to gouge players etc etc. Whatever you want to call it or feel  about it, it doesn't help you get a better price. All that matters in  Adam Smith's inflation world is what actual price did *you* get, and *when* did  it arrive. The market price a week before your item arrived is your  most usable comparable.  e.g. If 98 of your friends all paid $500, one  paid $100, and you paid $450, how do you feel? If you still feel upset  /scammed etc, get ready for a long and angst-filled life journey through  the collectibles industry. (Conversely yes, if you paid $550, instead  of getting madder, get smarter, and figure out how the $450-buyers did  what they did). If you are a long term holder, well, over 60% of all  high-volume collectibles TCG that we track eventually post a lower  post-release price than (all presell prices), so the odds lean towards a  post-release vs prerelease purchase anyway.  
&gt; Therefore,  yes, we have to throw our hats in the presell-bid-market to get any  units to sell lately. Thus our first flash and other prices rise  accordingly. If we can't get enough cheap units to meet a minimum level  we usually won't post a first flash for them, rather we'll just post  whatever market-priced units we could get.
&gt; In the end our bet is simple: regardless of MSRP or reddit or discord or etc thinks a price should be, if, *by release date*,  the general market pre-Sold price was @$x, and we were able to get our  units to our buyers @$x-10%, we will have repeat buyers, and if  profitable, a growing business. If not, out of business we go.

"Hi all,

I am a graduate student for a statistics program. I am looking to do a project in relation to regression for a class, I was interested in looking at each format (standard, modern, legacy, probably not vintage); and plotting the frequency that cards come up in effective ""meta"" decks and the price of cards. 

I would like to study data for commons, un commons, rares, and mythics separately. Basic lands are omitted for obvious reasons. There are other factors I plan on addressing, but am omitting for brevity.

Where would you recommend pulling price data?

"[[Yavimaya, Cradle of Growth]] seems to have stopped its decline. I wonder what your thoughts are on this card in the semi long term. Before it got reprinted a couple of times [[urborg, tomb of yawgmoth]] was pretty high in price.

I feel like wotc will not reprint this for a long while, and though supply is still pretty high for this card, there’s a lot of organic demand which will only grow, assuming commander as a format doesn’t slow down.

My take is that this will double in a year or so maybe more if it’s not reprinted for 2 yrs, curious for your opinion.","Thoughts on Yavimaya, Cradle of Growth long term?"
"I had a nice back and forth negotiation with a guy recently regarding a bunch of old borderfoils. For the purposes of our discussion I would include foils from Urza's Block/Masques/Invasion/any old border foils with a relatively low supply. 

Prices have been popping on these like a lot of other things of late. TCG Low for many of these (especially items that are not top tier) have seend 10x prices over the last year.

Primarily I am thinking of cards with a relatively low supply AND low demand. 

When looking at buying or selling these types of cards, what do you consider most? There appears to be a pretty limited supply. Most of the cards I was looking at had less than 10 foil copies on TCG player, and TCG Low prices were all bunched up at significantly higher prices than the most recent sale prices for these cards.   


For example - TCG Low for a low end FOIL rare from mercadian masques was listed at $50. But there had only been one sale in the last 3 months and it was for $5. What best arguments are you making to justify getting a lower or higher price for the card?   


It seems a few people are trying to market these \*NEW\* higher prices and focusing on their limited supply (TBH not sure just how limited the supply is), but how does that interact with the also seemingly limited demand.

I believe this would make them identical to the original versions of the Convention Playtest cards from 2019-2020. Knowing that these cards can be reprinted with the symbol on The List going forward, will this make the original playtest cards less desirable in favor for the 2021 Convention Edition that does not include the symbol?

But before you lose your mind and go full tilt rage mob, just hear me out and consider the implications of this was done carefully. 

First of all the parameters: cards banned/not legal in standard, pioneer, modern, and legacy. 

Example: Fastbond

Now imagine WotC could market a new masters set as having the “final printing!!” of cards that will “never be printed again!!” “Includes soon to be reserve list cards!!” I mean come on this would be a great hype machine to help make the machine more money. 

It would also create at least some collectibility for cards that have nearly no purpose left - what are you really going to do with a fastbond at this point anyway? You cannot play with it in any format that matters. At least the silly thing could be collectible. 

Best of all no one would ever pull a fastbond from a pack ever again. If Wizards reprinted fastbond and I pulled it in a masters set - at this point I’d be tilted. “What am I supposed to do with this!?! Play it in my vintage deck? Seriously!?”

To be clear I’m not talking about anything legal and or a staple of modern &amp; legacy. Nothing central to commander - though there might be commander legal cards that get hit from time to time. 

But then reserve list items like dual lands and time twister for example are legal in commander, so this isn’t an issue. 

The reserve list has been a massive benefit to magic. Having iconic cards that are truly rare and truly collective adds a certain element to the game and there is a way to add to that element without impacting the playability or accessibility of standard/pioneer/modern/legacy/commander in any significant way.

"The sale of the CGC ""authenticated"" after market Blastoise with an MTG back, opens up a whole new world of fan created products. What happens to the value of the fan created cards from the early days of MTG?

In short, both WOTC and Pokemont have rejected any insinuation they had a hand in its creation. WOTC has refused to acknowledge any authenticity of the card and Pokemon has done the same. Neither Pokemon nor WOTC have taken any steps to claim ownership of the card to block any sale. If the card was authentic, then both WOTC and Pokemon would have intellectual property claims under ""unpublished works"" provisions providing for products that have not come to market. This card would be considered unpublished as no MTG back Pokemon cards were ever sold commercially.

CGC created a new previously unrecognized category for ""authentication"" in ""test print"". It's unclear what ""authentication"" means with respect to this category as the ""printer"" of the cards is a not WOTC. There is no physical product available for sale by WOTC or Pokemon labeled ""test print"" so this category is wide category of products to ""authenticate"". CGC apparently will authenticate fan art and secondary market produced materials. This could mean that tokens produced by third parties, in store display materials, custom deck boxes, artist inspired work... Where does this go from here?

So a buyer paid $360,000 for a fan made card. The claims appear to be that an off work employee of WOTC contacted an off work employee of Carte Mundi and had them secretly create films after hours to produce these cards. 

This kind of Mission Impossible card creation appears to be unlikely due to the cost of such a process, the decades it took for these cards to surface, and the utter lack of any corroborating evidence being brought to light.

"Hey all, 

I have been an avid reader/follower of this subreddit for awhile. What I learned from this community helped me get into the investing side of Magic the Gathering. I started collecting sealed, I opened my own eBay store and I’ve spent way too much money and time on this hobby that I love 😆

Being Canadian, TCGPlayer is not really an option for me and I collect more than just Magic the Gathering (like Sports Cards). I enjoyed running a store on eBay, but I kept wanting something that was geared more towards the hobby of collecting and with lower seller fees. When I wasn’t able to find an alternative I decided to do it myself. So I quit my job leading the Product team at a mid sized tech company in Vancouver, BC to pursue my passion and dream of building a marketplace app for collectors to buy, sell and admire collectibles. I also convinced my friend who is our lead architect to do the same (he likes to say that we’ve both gone ‘nuts’ 😆).

We launched the beta version of the marketplace today. You can take a look at [https://skwirl.io](https://skwirl.io) and would love to hear any feedback, ideas or questions you may have. 

We started with the basics, but have big aspirations about building out the functionality over time. Collection tracking, price integration, ‘showcasing’ and admiring prized collectibles (and more) are all in the plans. We are driven by our passion as collectors and want to take feedback from the community to help steer our roadmap. 

So that’s where you all come in. I would love to hear from the community, from collectors, from investors, from players. What are you looking for in a marketplace? Are the current options meeting your needs? Do have interest in integrated social features that allow you to admire and follow other collectors? Is there something else we aren't thinking about that might fill a need in the hobby?

If you are interested in trying us out, the marketplace is live with a few hundred listings and many more will be added each day by our (currently small) group of sellers. It’s free to sign up and if you are interested in becoming a seller you can apply to our beta program on the website. I've been so busy with the launch that we don't have a ton of MTG up yet, but I plan to add 100s more listings this week.

Hoping this sparks a conversation with the community here, thanks so much for all the information you’ve shared over the years here as it has really helped us get to this point 🙇

"Hi all, little cautionary tale today.

Just a few minutes ago, I fucked up my attempt at filming the opening of a package containing a revised booster. Thought I'd share what happened and why you shouldn't repeat my mistakes.

Despite basically everyone I talked to about this idea warning me against it, I came up with an idea for how to buy a non-searched revised booster, and prove that it wasn't searched down the road.

I spoke to CardKingdom at length about the Revised booster pack they had on their site. I got pictures and direct confirmation that it came from their original booster box and hadn't been searched. The plan was to open this package on video, and then seal it in a second pound live on video. This pouch was then going to have a void sticker placed on it with some identifying marks to show that the sticker was never removed. Then, in a separate video, I was going to show the booster getting packed back up into a box headed for PSA to be graded. The same sticker would be on the bag containing the pack, the box would get sealed with another void sticker, and then I'd film the package getting dropped off to PSA with the same sticker.

Pack goes from CardKingdom to me while on camera the whole time, then goes from me to PSA on camera. Comes back graded and sealed. Thought it was a nifty little plan.

Well, after about 20 minutes of fiddling with this stupid phone ring light I bought just for this, I film the video. Halfway though, pack out from CardKingdom packaging but still not sealed in the void bag, I run out of memory and the video stops.

Well, that ain't gonna fucking work.

I delete some space off my phone and finish the video while sounding significantly more depressed. Doesn't really matter, as now there's two videos with no proof I didn't try to search in the middle. I showed the pack in the second video looking exactly the same, but I'm sure the problem still remains.

Thought you'd all enjoy laughing at this very dumb idea. The moral is - don't be dumb like me. Listen to people when they say not to buy searchable boosters unless you intend to open them yourself.",Don't be stupid like me and think you can pull off buying and holding a revised booster pack

"I'd like to propose [[Patriarch's Bidding]] as a compelling bulk spec that I'd expect to yield significant returns for anyone willing to sit on them for the 6-12 months. Actual holding time will largely depend on your desired returns and willingness/ability to sell them as singles but this seems like a nice, safe introductory spec for anyone who wants to toss a brick of $100.00 singles into a shoe box and buylist it for $500.00 a year later.

A good bulk spec, in my mind, has 2 primary components; the ease with which you can acquire a substantial number of copies at a desired price and its perceived growth over the next 6-12 months. That is, you need to be able to obtain a big stack of them with relative ease + for cheap and people need to be buying them *en masse* over the coming months. I feel that Bidding meets these two criteria which is the biggest reason why I like this as a bulk spec.

In terms of supply regular copies have ~400 listings on TCG and bricks can be acquired by the hundreds at the ~$1.50 price point. It's also abundant at most of the major vendors (CK, SCG, TnT, etc) which means that it's easy to convert credit or excess singles into a sizable stack of them. By any objective metric it's trivially easy for anyone reading this to develop a substantial position in this card with very little time or effort required.

Still, supply is irrelevant unless there's demand because the spec isn't useful unless it actually produces a worthwhile return. Luckily I believe that Bidding has more than enough going for it to experiences significant gains over the coming months. 

First and foremost it's an open-ended tribal support spell that can realistically be played in any Black casual/EDH tribal deck. When you look at some of the most popular Commanders on EDH Rec you see Najeela, Lathril, Ur-Dragon, Yuriko, Edgar, Anowon, Varina, First Sliver and a whole host of other ""tribal matters"" who could all realistically play a mass resurrection spell. Will they all? Certainly not; but it's powerful enough that most people will take it into consideration. Since the only requirement is that your deck is Black, the tribe itself is irrelevant, there's no reason to think that it's overall demand or desirability has anywhere to go but up.

Secondly, we're about to have a triple-header of tribal sets including 2 Black precons which will be tribal in nature. Both MID and VOW are showing signs of being extremely tribal-focused and since the combined ""Remastered"" set will likely continue that theme that's 2.5-4 major releases of tribes getting the spotlight. Moreover, we already know that UB Zombies and presumably BR Vampires are receiving dedicated Preconstructed Commander decks which will further bolster the demand for powerful tribal support enablers. In that sense it's not just about the tribal decks that are already built but also the ones that will be receiving the most attention over the coming 4 months.

Lastly, as more player start to play with Bidding it will trigger people who've long since forgotten about it to snag their copies for their existing and/or future decks. After all, the card was originally printed in Onslaught and so many players have forgotten about it, weren't aware of it to begin with and/or stopped caring about it once it hit $20-30.00 and became affordable. I predict that we'll see a lot of people purchasing them once they realize how much it's fallen in price, especially after facing down in an actual game of EDH.",Patriarch's Bidding (MH2)
"Hey all,

I'm sure similar threads have made their way through here but.. I haven't really played mtg in a while and have a bunch of cards laying around and I just want to get rid of everything outside maybe a few EDH decks, it's just a nuisance having them all. I'm wondering the best way to sell bulk cards? 

I have about 2 shoeboxes full of lands/commons/uncommons and a bunch of fat packs full of random stuff that may or may not be worth anything. I don't really want to take much time sorting through it all if I'm being honest either. I don't know if my local store would take them since they are kind of a small place. 

I've seen things like CardConduit will sort them out for you and price them but I'm not sure how worth it is for bulk items given the $0.03 fee.

I'm aware I'm not going to get a full retail price for them and I'm ok with that, really just want them gone but at least want to get something out of it. Suggestions?",Selling Bulk?

"Ok so I love tcg's. I am almost middle aged and I spend most of my free time checking prices, following trends, speculating watching Rudy ( sorry) talking to shop owners and trying to actually play the game of Magic. I get Tingley when a new Weiss set comes out and I just discovered Weiss 2 days ago. So it's clear to me that Magical Finance is intrinsically satisficing to my brain/being/parasympathetic nervous system. So I am thinking about making the plunge...

 I know the margins are thin, the liquidity is bad and in an era of race to the bottom to MSRP vanishing distributer direct Amazon without a store I simply will not have the capital to compete at scale. BUUUUUT if I can get Pokémon boxes at 85, Collector boxes at 160, fire sale clearance from distributer with the intention of holding long ( and strong) all while doing it in a tax efficient vehicle with no personal liability ( LLC) I can continue my obsession in a somewhat more intelligent way. With third party transaction processors reporting standard changing next year I am almost forced to become a business as a 600$ reporting threshold basically covers any one who sells on ebay regardless of their motives. SO I am thinking 2022 is the year.

 In my state the 800 LLC filling is free for 2 years, reseller's license will save me almost 10% in sales tax and I could write off top loaders which have become the most inflated commodity of the tcg world. Also possibly my son's medical bills as he occasionally eats Pokémon cards. ( kidding, kind of) 

 My volumes are low as I am not thinking really like a business but I do have a proof of model with some validity and an ebay Account with aprox 200 reviews and 100% positive after a year and my first moth on TCGplayer has me at almost level 4. I am learning Facebook market place and have LGS store owner friends. 

 I know we all drink of the twisted cup that is MTG finance for better or worse so I am hoping for some collective wisdom, advice, feedback, trolling and anecdotes for a dude high and happy of the witches brew atm. DO I do it? Is it worth it? 

 Oh and I plan on funding the business with my collection, no debt and online ( limited overhead)

"Hey, I just picked up the Aura of Courage precon today and saw this card in the deck list and was scratching my head as to why it's so cheap.

Card is bonkers good especially when you've got [[sigarda's aid]] or any way to bypass the equip cost which seems to be quite popular in this deck archetype anyway, that [[Masterwork of ingenuity]] should be in every equipment deck.

Just thought I'd throw it out there as I think everyone has missed this card's value.  Being that it copies any equipment on the battlefield and not just your own is so flexible and an autoinclude in a budget deck.  Steal a sweet sword like feast and famine and still have the rest of your mana on turn before untapping after combat.  I know creature decks aren't the strongest, but this is from what I can see, the cheapest copy of any/your best equipment card out there.  Definitely seems undervalued.

"With the glut of releases, I just wanted to make sure for both people trying to make money speculating and for people wanting to collect cards on the cheap, that you might want to wait a little longer than usual for Midnight Hunt and Crimson Vow singles.

If you find some good deals, are impatient, or just really *REALLY* like the showcase/whatever art treatment, then by all means do whatever you want, but it would still behoove you to wait until probably February.

This is for the simple reason that the Innistrad Double Feature is releasing then, which is an interesting new product, basically appearing to be a mash-up of Secret Lair - all new visual treatments, Remasterd Set - two previous sets made a cohesive whole as one, and Universes Beyond - a set as it's own identity/style, etc.

So while [[Wrenn and Seven]] or whatever may appear to be the new hotness, and you might *really* like that borderless frame, not only might you like the ""creature feature"" showcase frame from the upcoming Innistrad Double Feature set even MORE, but they will all be less expensive across the board thanks to massive printing and multiple versions vying for attention.

Basically, take a breath, take a moment and wait for the best price for what you want.

This also adds an additional element to the 4D chess of speculating because the window for what card/what version is the chase card and if it even gets included in Double Feature could be particularly small.  

Still, above all I'm predicting low, low singles prices across the board because not only do we have so many versions of cards, but they're stretched over a timeline of 3 set releases.

So good luck, don't be stupid.",PSA: The next two sets will have even more value loss than usual

"Whether you collect or deal in magic cards, it's important to keep them in good condition. Simply storing your cards in penny sleeves together or separately can cause damage in the long run if you don't replace them on occasion. I will be specifically focusing on penny sleeves here and not deck sleeves

The imgur link below has some examples attached and will detail each example so you can see exact what has happened and why in order to prevent it from happening to your cards. All cards have been stored in a box in the same sleeves for approximately 10 years give or take.  
https://imgur.com/a/475BshZ



*Millikin*  
The first 2 images show what this Millikin and the sleeve look like after about a decade in storage along with what the sleeve would look like brand new.  
This Millikin was already in played condition but did not have nearly the amount of scratching and scuffing. Some was already there but a significant amount was caused by the sleeve.

*Skycloud Egg*  
The next 2 images are the Skycloud Eggs that were stored in a sleeve that became hardened and brittle. Both Eggs were Near Mint and stored in the same sleeve. The Egg on the right was in front. You can see the kind of damage that the sleeve caused despite minor degradation across the face of the card while the left one looks great still and took no damage being stacked together. You can also see a tiny small pock mark from a piece of dust that got in due to the hardening. The card still looks NM and is only noticeable due to zooming or from an inch away.

*Shadowblood Egg**  
This Shadowblood Egg was stored in a sleeve that became hardened along with a fresh sleeve for perspective. The card had some minor surface scratches and scuffing when stored. The hardened sleeve caused some clouding and some additional minor microscratches along the card. 

*Sungrass Egg*  
The last 3 images are Sungrass Eggs both were Near Mint when stored in a hardened sleeve although the back of the Egg on the left has a factory printing error which you can actually see imprinted onto the sleeve. The right egg was in front and incurred a tiny amount of clouding or loss of sheen. It's still Near Mint although it was pack fresh before. The left egg was in back. You can see it's now SP due to some vertical scratches on the front that it incurred from being stored in the same sleeve. It also took some horizontal scratches from sleeve damage on the back right.


**Identifying Storage Damage**  
Sleeves can become hardened, brittle, or both as they age  
+ Hardened sleeves tend to expand which allow moisture and dust in. This can cause spotting, clouding, and more  
+ Brittle sleeves can cause scratches and scuffing
+ They can both cause microscratches, the smooth patches of scratching, and wear specifically around the black borders. Playwear from Deck sleeves can also cause similar border wear  
+ Vertical scratches and diagonal scratches above about 45 degrees are generally caused by cards being stacked together in the same sleeve  
+ long horizontal scratches are frequently caused by unsleeved playwear while shorter horizontal scratches or those under 45 degress are more likely to come from degrading sleeves that have become brittle  


**Preventing Storage Damage**  
Penny sleeves tend to damage the faces of foils at significantly higher rates than non-foils or the backs of either card as they age. Old frame foils seem to be more inclined to be damaged compared to new frames, although some foils are extremely robust when it comes to avoiding damage. Timeshifted foils, FTV foils, and Pokemon holos seem to have significantly lower rates of damage and sleeve degradation. Different brands and types of penny sleeves seem to be more likely to wear certain ways or sometime not at all. I'd guestimate that about 50% of sleeves needed replacing be replaced after 10 years and about 25% of foils showed some damage from those sleeves. For sleeves stored in top loaders, less than 10% needed replacement and the amount that incurred store damage was infinitesimally small  
+ Store sleeved cards of value in top loaders. This will prolong the lifespan of the sleeve  
+ Store cards individually in sleeves. If storing multiple cards in a sleeve, try to store no more than 10 non-foils or 8 foils. For foils, place half facing each way to reduce warping. If they don't comfortably fit, use less
+ Make sure your cards are stored snugly and not too loose or too tight. Too loose will cause friction that will lower the lifespan of the sleeve and cause more damage as the sleeve degrades. Too tight can cause pressure marks on the fronts of foils stacked behind others or increase odds of warping. 
+ When using dividers make sure they're solid and not soft or flimsy. Tournament and set deck boxes are great, but make sure they're full of cards and don't use them as dividers when empty. 
+ Replace your penny sleeves every 5 years to be safe or when they start to look like they'll deteriorate.  

What have all of your experiences been with long term storage and how often do you replace or cycle out your sleeves?

This post was inspired by a recent unpleasant interaction with one of the major sleeve manufacturers during an effort to get answers. They were very evasive, flat out denied it was their sleeves that caused the problem, and that they couldn't help before hanging up.

"Hello everyone, these days I came across speculations of WotC cutting the Draft Booster Boxes production to push higher revenue margin through Set Booster Boxes.   
I'm talking in particular about 2 videos:   
👉 [YOU WILL BUY SET BOXES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYnO_6jLJQY&amp;t=301s) of Alpha Investment  
👉 [Let’s Clear Up A Few Things About The Cost Of Magic: The Gathering Cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STFG2iGTocQ) of Totalitarian Community College

Now what both Rudy and the Professor argue is that WotC is purposefully cutting the production of draft buster boxes because they basically want better margin selling more Set Booster Boxes.  


If you look up the page ""[THE BOOSTERS AND PRODUCTS OF INNISTRAD: MIDNIGHT HUNT](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/boosters-and-products-innistrad-midnight-hunt-2021-09-02)"" **Set Booster Boxes are the first product presented!!!**  
And they are introduced as follow: 

*""Set Boosters are awesome ways to expand—or get started with—your Magic collection.""*

Some cards for Commander Format are going to be available only in Set Boosters! Which is a different strategy from the one they have used to push other products, such as Collector Boosters, where you could find unique variants of cards available also in Draft Boosters.

And is it just a coincidence that **the Design of the new Set Booster Box Case looks just like the Booster Box Case?**

[Midnight Hunt Set Booster Box](https://preview.redd.it/uc4bn3dconl71.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3c6ccd4de1b6e198dbc7b94e892973ac9fc0690)

&amp;#x200B;

# Let's crunch some Numbers

Draft Box: 

* 36 Packs
* Wholesale price to LGS 👉 80$ (Wizards probably sells to distributor at 70$)
* 36 Packs \* 15 Card/Pack = 540 Cards

Set Box: 

* 30 Packs
* Wholesale price to LGS 👉 90$ (Wizards probably sells to distributor at 80$?)
* 30 Packs \* 12 Card/Pack = 360 Cards

&amp;#x200B;

(36 - 30) /36 \* 100 = 17% less Boosters per unit (Box) 

(540 - 360) / 540 \* 100 = 33% less cards per unit (Box)  

So basically, what they are doing is **diminishing the product quantity per unit** (Box) while at the same time **increasing the price per unit** (Box).

&amp;#x200B;

To simplify the achievement for WotC is an increase of 30% Ca. in Profit.

"Hi guys,

as we all know, the prices of RL cards go through cycles where very 1 or 2 years prices explode hard, then slowly retrace over a couple of months until they bottom out and then stay there until the next catalyst comes around to male prices go up again. These cycles seem to have been somewhat correlated to cryptoprices, partially probably because of people taking their crypto-profits and putting them into MtG.

The last of these price explosions was around the end of last year/beginning of this year with some retracements and stabilizing ever since march/april.

What I want to get some opinions on is if we are maybe seeing the beginning-signs of another one of such cycles. Here are my points:

* crypto is on a run again in the last few weeks. Now I am not saying that this means the RL has to follow soon but it may mean that some money could flow into collectables soon, once people start taking profits.
* I am watching MtG stocks almost daily and there seem to be a few RL-cards going up in price every few days now for the last few weeks. Maybe that is already the start or maybe this is just normal demand that is around all year.
* I am seeing more and more chatter from folks, asking if they should invest now/if we hit the bottom for RL prices and likewise other chatter from people calling the bottom, so interest seems to be climbing again.
* Likewise there seem to be more threads opened asking about specific RL cards on this subreddit in the last few weeks than in the months before (just as an example: right now there are threads talking about Metalworker, Tombstone stairwell and City of Traitors respectably). 
* Thanks to some recent spoilers some few RL cards have spiked because their playability ‚went up‘ (Tombstone Stairwell just now and for MH2 for example Liege of the Hollows and Frenetic Efreet). This may lead to people thinking about what RL cards may be still cheap in respect of their future playability, leading to more eyes on the RL.

what do you guys think? Am I just interpreting too much into all this or are we maybe seeing the early signs of a start of a new cycle in the RL?

Since the rarity symbol on Eldrazi Monument is Mythic and the other 4 are Rare, this still isn't a big enough sample to know if that symbol is reflected in card quantities.

Other takeaways are that Esper has by far the best bonus cards, followed by Grixis, although without prices on the foil Jumpstart lands and Terramorphic Expanse it's hard to say for sure. I also don't know about Bant, but its value greatly depends on whether Teferi is an available pull. With it, it would compete with Esper for the best, and without it, it's probably below Grixis.",Secret Lair Secretorium Superdrop bonus card drops from 402 boxes
"So I was updating my deck lists on MoxField today and one of my decks has a foil [[Preators grasp]] that I bought years ago for like £5 and MoxField and TCG player claim its like $70 [As seen here](https://i.imgur.com/bbdAzFJ.jpg) so I checked card market where I believe the cheapest place to buy cards and its just under £20 which is still a bit high tbh, and it's a old foil with one printing, sees commander play and [[prosper tome bound]] probably hasn't helped. Obviously it's gonna go up unless it gets a reprint but are these prices exaggerated?",[[Preators grasp]] foil prices?
"Ever since [[Wilhelt, The Rotcleaver]] was revealed there's been a lot of buzz around [[Tombstone Stairwell]] as a potential spec. Not only is the card on the Reserved List but it's one of the only forms of persistent mass Zombie production. For example, in an EDH game where you have 5 creatures in your graveyard this thing is churning out 20 Zombies every circuit which is obviously insane if you have a card like Wilhelm or [[Chatterfang, Squirrel General]] in play. Not only can you turn 20 temporary bodies into 20 ""permanent"" ones (Wilhelm's have Decay but still) but it also means that sac outlets like [[Phyrexian Altar]] and ""death payoffs"" like [[Blood Artist]], [[Zulaport Cutthroat]], [[Plague Belcher]] and [[Vengeful Dead]] become monster finishers. Note that cards like [[Blood Artist]] and [[Vengeful Dead]] trigger off of opposing deaths as well which is critical given that it produces bodies for each player on each turn which effectively makes any of these 2-card combos where the only required component is Stairwell.

What I like about this spec outside of the obvious Reserved List safety net is the fact that it scales well with past/present/future Commanders such as [[Chatterfang, Squirrel General]] which will gladly play this in order to pump out an army every circuit. Essentially anything Black that cares about making or killing creatures will probably want this card so it's not like you're even spec'ing on this Commander alone. 

Reasonable demand, low supply and Reserved List are all good feathers to have in your cap so I definitely like it as a spec if you can still find them in the ~$20.00 range. Even if it's just to have one in case you want to build/play the deck now might be the best time to snag one.","Tombstone Stairwell (RL) as a Wilhelt, the Rotcleaver Spec"
"I'm a pure investor, not a player, so I don't know the answer to the question as to whether any RL card or cards have ever been unbanned?  If so, what was the market effect?  I'd think there'd be a massive impact if it was to occur nowadays.  I mean - look at Stoneforge Mystic, which has skyrocketed since it was unbanned; and that's despite the Double Masters reprint.

This also reinforces at least one of the reasons why RL cards don't get unbanned, namely the inability of WoTC to be able to cash in via a marquee reprint.  Plus I do know there's a vocal contingent who feel all RL cards should be banned from formats like EDH so as to level the playing field, although isn't that what proxies are for?

Does anyone think it is at all realistic to envision any RL cards getting unbanned from the format(s) in which they're currently banned, even if such a thing hasn't occurred, if ever, in many a moon?  If so, what cards do you see as contenders?

"Quick question bout city of traitors the rl card from Exodus.
I wanted one for a edh deck and I noticed that they were quite a bit more expensive to find then some time a go.

Matter a fact: took me quite some work to get rid of some about a year ago, so in my mind it was one of those expensive rl cards without good liquidity.

I can't find a decent English one below 200 now, and ppl I tried to convince to sell below their price all were very hard to convince to part below this price.

I know monolith and mox diamond have shot up in price due the explosion of edh, I guess City of traitors fits the broken ramp for a cedh deck part. But I do think if I made this mistake maybe more people don't realise that this ship is sailing. Especially 2-3 mana generals, monocolors and such should want this sooner or later. I think this card still has room for growth and that's why I did decide to buy one for the asking price. I don't think it's OK to wait any longer. What do you think?",City of traitors / future- room to grow??
"How much is known about non standard drop rates for cards within a set/booster pack?

I've googled a fair amount and have not been able to come across much official (or even non official) information on the topic. Ultimately, I'd like to use this information to create a box/pack EV calculation. 

&amp;#x200B;

* How often is a given card foiled? 
* How often does a given card have alternate art (borderless/retro framed/etc.) ? 
* Are these rates constant across rarities? (Eg. Is a mythic foil as likely as a common foil within their respective slots?)

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to share the best info I've come across in my search. Here's an official source that I think can shed some light on #2: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vrt0W6rJFs&amp;t=265s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vrt0W6rJFs&amp;t=265s)

According the WOTC employee in the video, for the upcoming Innistrad set, we can be certain that alternate art styles (Eternal Night Legends, Equinox frame, and Borderless) appear 33% of the time in a given slot within a draft booster. How likely is this rule to extend to set boosters as well? And, more importantly, how likely is this rule to extend to previously printed sets?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The only foil information I've run across is 1 in 67 cards pre-Core 2020 will be replaced with a random foil of any rarity, and 1 in 45 post Core 2020.  I do not have an official source on this info.

Hey everyone,

Am I the only person who thinks this card should be valued higher?

The effect in commander seems so powerful when you can make lots of copies a valuable target such as your commander or other bomb creature.

My plans for this card is to go into my Yuriko deck and using [[Sakashima of a thousand faces]] to negate the legendary rule to trigger yuriko several times hoping to KO my opponents.

Maybe this is all just magical faerie land, but I see potential.

Being new to the game, I lack a lot of game knowledge, but when building my yuriko deck I stumbled across this card and felt its effect seems very powerful in the above situation.

I feel this card could easily jump to $3 in regular and $10 in foil and not seeing any reprint in the near future.

Also see EA treatment jump up to $10.

"With their aggressive reprints as of lately and record low pricing, now is a good time to pick them up. They are, next to duals and basic island, the best and most powerful land cards ever printed. They are played in every format where they are legal, they fit into practically every 2+ colored deck and by their very nature enable many specific strategies (graveyard, landfall shenanigans etc.). Now you might have some doubts and let me answer them for you:

1. Won’t they become cheaper as people are still opening up packs? 

Potentially yes but usually some months after release they bottom out (historically speaking). If you consider fluctuations that appear naturally, like buying in bulk from somewhere close vs a few from somewhere far, a new deck gaining attention etc, than these changes will likely “percentually” be higher than the dipping in price. 

2. They might be reprinted next year though!!

Sure they might but why should they. Wotc is aware of the second hand market and they know how releasing expensive fetches in sets boosts purchases. Wotc puts effort in lowering prices to a reasonable level but they like to keep expensive cards, well, expensive. This is not (!) always the truth but in a wast wast majority of the cases it is. If a card tanks in price after a reprint, it is usually because it was printed once many years ago and interest was more casually based (think of random commander cards). They don’t want to cause fetch fatigue. Product needs to remain interesting.

3. Why should they increase in price though?

People coming back from covid into irl play and ever increasing playerbase number wise. Despite what many think, or more accurately what they wish, is happening - a decrease in player numbers because of TWD, DnD or Fortnite - more and more people come into magic. It’s a good game after all. Fetches are used everywhere and usually in multiples and also often you need them in many decks. That is a perfect card to bet on.

Of course these are just my thoughts. Think wisely, don’t spend more money than you can afford to lose and also always remember, you don’t lose money if you use these cards.","Remember kids, now - more than ever - is the right time to pick up enemy fetches."

While the differences aren't pronounced in every case, what this seems to show is either the last price was the highest or August prices as a whole tended to be greater than those from July.

"Hello. I live in the states, and my partner is learning Italian, so we thought it'd be fun to order an Italian box of Modern Horizons 2. I went through cardmarket and used the German forwarding service mailbox.de. I made sure I ordered an Italian box, and paid to fully insure it through the forwarding service. When it arrived, it was in English. I was pretty pissed, because if I wanted an English box I wouldn't have paid to change my usd into Euros through PayPal, nor paid for the forwarding service. I would have just bought an English box. When I messaged the seller they were nice about it, but they only offered me a partial refund that wouldn't even make it cheaper than just buying an English box here (putting aside the fact that I'm not even interested in an English box at all). Also, I don't know if the refund will go to cardmarket credit, and if that can even be turned back into usd. When I declined this, they offered to pay expenses to send the box back to them and they'll replace it with an Italian box, but that seems suspicious, not to mention still costing money on my part. The way I see it, it was their mistake, so there's no reason why I should have to pay more money than I already have. I have a video of myself opening the package and realizing it was in English, as well as information from mailbox.de proving that I had it forwarded.

I feel that JP boxes in draft and set are kind of only good for the alt art, unless I do the whole collection in Japanese. What do y'all think? Collectors boxes? Set or draft boxes? Or singles?",Starting my first collection

"I've been aiming at buylisting into higher and stable value RL cards and I feel comfortable with what I have now. I'm now looking to diversify a bit into graded cards. I understand that getting anything actually graded right now is unrealistic since many sites are backed up, but I was looking to at least try getting some cards and putting them to the side for now. I did have a few questions about this though:


- Is there a preferred method for researching recently sold graded cards? I was looking at eBay primarily but are there good resources worth noting?
- Based off what I can tell, it seems like PSA &amp; BGS are the big two for MTG grading. Are there any preferences in the MTGFinance community about one vs the other? (Again, assuming one could actually get something graded)",Suggested resources for getting into graded cards?

"With the announcement of the upcoming secret Lair drop for Fortnite and Street Fighter. Love it or hate it Fortnite is still has a huge presence in the gaming world as well as Street Fighter. I have several questions about it.

1: Will the popularity of these two games affect the value of their secret layer when it drops. 

2: Will the childish theme of the cards from the Fortnite drop cause people not by it, or will it bring a new younger generation into MTG. Causing the value of the Fortnite pack to increase.

3: For the Street Fighter games, I believe there is an older demographic than what Fortnite provides. So I am not sure how it will play out when they get their drop. I assume many of us, that already playing magic, have at least played Street Fighter since it's a well-known game or might be a fan of the series.

This brings me to my second topic about the Lord of the Rings set coming out in 2023. Since Lord of the Rings is a huge franchise I assume that it will be a sought-after set. My main question about the Lord of the Rings. Said is if it will do good when it actually hits the shelf, to r if it will just be like a normal set release.

"Looking for some opinions on this, I've been looking to pick up a [[The Great Henge]] for a while now but the price tag is pretty off-putting, especially considering it will rotate out of standard soon.

That said, I know this card is popular for EDH decks (which is why I'm looking for one) and I'm wondering if it will see enough of a drop in price within a few months after rotation to make it more appealing, or if it will stay around its current price point due to its EDH popularity.  Thoughts?

For reference, my LGS is selling regular copies for $65 CAD ($50 USD), I'm hoping it drops to within the $40 - $50 CAD range ($30 - $40 USD)

Also, generally speaking, when do you find that card prices dive after rotation? 1 month? 3 months? 1 year?  Curious to see others views.",The Great Henge pricing after standard rotation

"Unfortunately - and I have no doubt directly linked to Covid - I'm seeing a noticeable spike in the following both online and in my local area in Florida:

1) Estate sale listings where collectibles like TCG cards are explicitly advertised for sale;

2) Families of collectors bringing their collections to consignment or game stores following their passing wanting to simply get rid of them;

3) Parents, spouses, or children of the deceased posting on various groups trying to figure out what exactly they've just inherited and what it's worth. 

So, two immediate questions come to my mind in this case - 


- How comfortable do you feel engaging in the business of snapping up opportunities like these given the circumstances? What are your principles/ethics, lines that you won't cross, deals that are too good to pass up? 

I've seen, first-hand, a collection consisting of multiple Rubbermaid tubs of cards spanning Tempest and Urza block, with all the inherent goodies therein, that a family dropped off at an LGS locally this week for $200. They just wanted to liquidate following the collector's passing and that was their asking price, and the owner didn't argue, reasoning they were satisfied with the deal.  

- What precautions have you taken to avoid your own collection falling into such a fate? Have you made a will? Do you brief your family on the value of your collection and give them instructions on who to contact if anything should happen? Something else?","Serious Finance Post, But Depressing Topic... When Collectors Die From COVID And The Fate Of Their Collections"
" Ok so I am going to take a crack and the release race to the bottom, by pre-ordering a collectors booster box or two and seeing if i can flip to break even. I also want to build a sealed position as I see them as a decent way to gain exspoure and diversity to an asset class that performs better at times then the SPY and holds up well during down cycles. Also  I just want to try it. I like the 187 option on ebay from  eastbay finds but I have never heard of them, they do not seem to specialize in Magic and I have been personally following the horror show of pre-sale shenanigan's that this sub has shared over the last 18 months. SO a safer option would be mvp which is at 200 for me which is approximately on par with next cheapest on ebay 

 A few options I am contemplating: 

 Buy 1 to crack/flip/collect and one to hold- 200 seems like at worst I would loose 25% for the privilage of cracking packs and the labor to push the cards. Not irrelevant as it might take 3 hrs to list and ship and 25% would be what I would need to discount ( assumption) to liquidate pulls to get out of my position if they suddenly tank or something the first week. Of course the opposite could happen and the hype train might boost single prices and major stores sell locally due to better margins and steady demand? IDK just an assumption. 200 as a hold seems verry safe as it would need to clear 210 plus 30 ( shipping, transaction fees) and my holding period is 6 months to forever. The cost of holding it is basically the issued return of the s&amp;p or the lost opportunity of a better magic product during the holding time to me as this is coming out of my "" magic/investment fund"" and I do not need the cash. A possible opportunity cost on missout out magic products could be the 30% average ( assumption) spread between buy-list and retail which is assuming I can buy cards 30% off which it totally attainable.

 Option 2 yolo- get a paypal credit card "" pay in 6 months 0% apy"" buy 12 @ 169.76 from an unknown vendor, on margin which is 23% if I don't pay off the balance( assuming my actual credit terms are not better or worse) and obviously flip my ass off as the carry might be 23% unless I cough up 2k in 6 months from other sources. Same execution risk with added default risk/stress but added benefit of increased profits and feeling like a boss. I guess I could just go on margin at a smaller total cost but 12 seems like the max I can handle and yolo is about high risk/reward 

 option 3: liquidate my collection to buy outright as many box's that I can afford with the intention of making a reasonable return over time. For me that might be 2 boxes as I do want to have capital free to buy other stuff so I can buy other stuff. The hidden cost of holding is basically you have not spend that money on other stuff it seems as sealed has performed pretty well across long time frames.

option 4- wait for a fire sale on Amazon- I really don't think I will be able to execute this as any real "" stel"" will go in minutes but I would have the added benefit of buying with more imformation about how the product is recieved by the public an possible arbitrage opportunities as a margin of saftey if I need to liquidate quickly. 

 Ok I am not a finance guy but flipping/collecting has forced me to learn finanitial concepts and I would love any feedback/critiqes.",Questions about finance and presale strategy on Collector booster

"Mystery Booster (Convention 2021 edition) boxes are going between $250-300 right now, which is way higher than the retail edition boxes that were between $130-200 around the time of its release in 2020 spring. Instead of the foil slot, we were given an edited version of the playtest cards from the original convention edition (which has a weird history in itself). 

So, was this change worth it, financially speaking? My answer is no. I personally haven't seen little to no interest in these playtest cards.  Not many are selling on TCGPlayer nor on Facebook, and those who are interested in them usually only need one copy for their collection. Unfortunately, these cards are hoarding most of the set's EV, and I believe these things will inevitably tank as supply outgrows demand. 

At the time of posting this, only 29 cards in the set are worth more than $10 (Tcgplayer.com market price) not including Rhystic Study, which was removed from the set. 6 mythics, 13 rares, 6 uncommons, and 1 common, out of a pool of 1,694 cards. So odds are you are not likely going to get close to the EV of what these boxes are retailing for.

Unless demand picks up for these playtest cards, or the boxes plummet in price, (which is the more likely situation) I'd wait to even think about these things until that adjustment happens.


Bonus rant: The removal of the PW symbol on the playtest cards as being the only difference from the 1st editions was such a poor decision for logistics in the secondary market. I can't tell you how many times I see someone posting their playtest card and bragging about how much it's worth, only to be corrected that they're looking at the wrong price. If you look on TCG, the original playtest cards are pretty difficult to buy right now because people are mistakenly listing the newer versions under the original listing. What a mess!

" Hey everyone,

I'm still tracking my *Arabian Nights* bet (OP of march 28 : [https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/mfezw0/wild\_prediction\_about\_arabian\_nights/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/mfezw0/wild_prediction_about_arabian_nights/) )

It's been a while since I posted a follow up. The summer was interesting : supply went up and, of course, prices consolidated. I suppose some took profits while the new high prices prompted some old players to look through their old shoes boxes. To be honest though, some price went much lower than I expected while others actually held their own, or even went higher.

We're in a strange spot right now, where price are definitely down from the high of may, while supply is dwindling on CardKingdom BUT soaring on TCGPlayer. I'm not sure what it means right now. It's common sense though that MTG always cool down in the summer and take off in spring. We'll see how that affect *Arabian Nights* prices.

I stand by my bet, but it really doesn't seem granted as of right now. Feel free to comment.

One month after AFR, and I am looking at buying the mythic dragons x5 (borderless). According to mtg goldfish, Icingdeath, Iymrith, Ebondeath, and Inferno, have all decreased in price. However Old Gnawbone has increased. Am I right in saying, none of these cards are staples? Therefore, their prices lowering makes sense? Why is this not the case for Old Gnawbone? Due to being the strongest of the five? Is this something I could have predicted, ie should I have bought Old Gnawbone opening weekend, and waited a month for the other four?

Also, mtg goldfish and mtg price, are showing different price trends. Is one more accurate than the other?

"Context: Long time player new-ish to the finance side. Decent knowledge of 60 card formats. c/EDH much less so, but I get the format is a fairly big driver of singles sales.

I have been doing some digging on MTGStocks and the like to try and understand what happens to card prices in sets that rotate out. Forming my own opinions from the data I am looking at, but curious to get the ""crowd wisdom"" on the subject.

For those completely unaware, there is a Standard rotation coming Sept. 17, 2021.

From what I can tell:

- Standard staples that have no current home in Modern tend to crash or dip, but seem to generally recover based on the actual strength of the card/meta changes/supply drying up after the initial flood of rotated cards hitting the market. I expect EDH demand is the primary driver here, slowly eating through available supply, slowing causing prices to creep back as people swap in newer cards to replace older ones (due to power creep).

- Cards that can be expected to see continued play in other formats due to their power level (that aren't banned) see little-to-no price dip, and tend to creep upwards after a lull (caused by temporary increased supply) due to a generally shrinking supply over time.

- Trash remains trash and gets priced as bulk. No surprises here.

Does this check out with people's experience or analyses? Am I way off base? Are there other archetypes for price fluctuation trends (around rotation specifically) that should be watched for?

"INTRO
There has been a lot of drama, as well as some positive threads about what the amount of releases &amp; cross-overs could mean for magic the gathering and its overall health.

Will it grow the player base or will it destroy it?

What I will try to dissect here is how I would look at this from a finance person at Hasbro that looks at MtG as an asset. With this I mean that I would like to see growth for the company both short, middle AND long-term.

To analyze this I would try to identify appropriate KPIs (key performance indicators) together with the teams that develop this &amp; perform market research with those who buy it. There are 2 sets of KPIs:

(1) lag indicators (e.g. sales, customer feedback once a set is released) which provide me a very interesting insight in the current state of my asset. These KPIs will not actually help me predict the future. Meaning that sales could be great in 2021 (eg MH2/secret lairs/AFR), but they won’t help me to predict the mid to longer term predictions. So I need a second type of KPIs.

(2) lead indicators - these are indicators that try and help me predict the future. From a business point of view I like these the most as they will help me project the future &amp; will give me an insight in a more distant future.

These will guide decisions about further pushing the strategy the strategy that we are seeing or potentially course correct. Yes, WoTC (or business daddy habro) is in it for the money, but long term growth/perspective is also important for the company &amp; it’s investors.


DISCUSSION 
Now, what would be some good lead KPIs to identify (as objectively as possible) the state of magic. I acknowledge that this is subjective (some will be happy other won’t), but objectively a continuously growing player base and associated sales increase should be seen as a success for the community &amp; the company.

My top picks &amp; rationale for this being a potentially good lead KPI:
(1) amount of people buying pre-cons / entry products (jump start) . These people are the oxygen for further growth. I look at them as initially just trying a new game, but if they like it they might become hooked &amp; generate further sales.

(2)increased cost of RL cards. Yes - this might be controversial- I believe that this one shows a great example of supply &amp; demand. RL supply is finite. This means that if prices of RL cards continue to rise that the demand is there. I see this as proxy that there is a healthy amount of players looking to “improve” their decks with “iconic” cards. I presume based on this that there will also be a healthy demand in the next year(s) to buy new product as well if these contain reprinted or new staples .

(3) traction of MtG on the internet (excluding Arena). If more people watch mtg on YouTube / Twitch they cane expected to also want to do “cool stuff “ with their decks even if it’s kitchen table magic with friends

CONCLUSION 

Based 3 lead KPIs I consider MtG to be in a fairly healthy state which means for me that WoTC will continue with their current strategy. Some minor course corrections could occur, but unless there are some objective (not emotional) indicators flagging a risk we will see more of the same.

TLDR: you might not like the direction MTG is going, but overall - based on some indicators I see as a potential proxy for the future - it seems to be in a healthy state.",2022 releases: what it could mean for MtG

So, I understand that this is a bold accusation. And it's not made lightly. I have purchased 5 lots from them in an attempt to decide for myself if this was true.

I bought my first lot a few months back and, in the listing, it had showed a small (old looking) 550ish box of cards and showed 9 cards on three pictures. 2.7ish Pounds. Each of the pictures showed older Rares or valuable commons/Uncommons. Upon receiving the item, I looked through the box to find a box of nearly untouched Near Mint Throne Of Eldraine commons and the 9 cards from the pictures randomly (seemingly) placed through out the box. No Rares (not even an uncommon in the box).

So out of curiosity I ordered 4 more boxes. If you know where to find them then you'll know where I'm talking about looking, you'll see they sell 2.7 pound boxes. These boxes are 100% stacked! All 4 boxes I bought were the exact same thing. In two of the boxes I ordered they simply put the cards in the picture at the end of the box all together.  A bunch of new almost untouched commons from newer sets with 7-9 well placed decent to awesome cards in an older looking box.

So to those of you who do what I do please be careful with this store. Under the auction page they just show up as ""Goodwill Retail Services, Inc."" You need to click that name and it will show their location and real store name.

They'll take the cards and split them up into  ""Classic Core 1 &amp; 2"" and the Classic Expansions.

[Old-Border Foil Talismans](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Talisman+of+is%3Aold)**:** Talismans are an EDH staple that also see occasional play in other formats. The old-border foil treatment is all the rage right now, but I can see a future where WOTC moves on to the next flavor-of-the-month card treatment and the whales will be trying to bling their old-border EDH decks with Grim Monoliths and Urza, Lord High Artificers. If casual players pick them up too, I can see these going for $10, esp. for the blue-creating ones.   


[Scholar of the Lost Trove](https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/a/a/aa254a86-3c30-408d-9c14-befd472f9740.jpg?1608312712)**:** This is the only foil card in the JumpStart set, and it's a great card for casual play. I don't think it's ever going to price-match bombs like Consecrated Sphinx, but the synergy with spell-based decks, reanimator decks, and artifact decks gives it a really wide spread of potential homes. Also, it saw a TON of play in Historic on Arena doing really EDH-looking things like slamming Genesis Ultimatums. If people learn to love magic on Arena and then build EDH decks, I can see them jamming this based on their experience online.

I could definitely see it going in the direction of Archmage's Charm over the long-term, where foils top $20. It's a very unique effect where the floor of the card is a pseudo-counterspell in multiple formats and the ceiling is cheating your own cards into play with Uro and Phyrexian Dreadnought - lots of room for new combo pieces to be printed in the future.

[Foil Old-Border Basics](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%28type%3Aland+type%3Abasic%29+is%3Aold&amp;unique=art&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name): This covers multiple sets but it's still possible to get dozens of copies of foil basics from Onslaught, Odyssey, and other older sets for sub-$5. A lot of the ""Moderately Played"" basics look better in person than you expect, and can be worth a gamble. That said, there aren't a whole heckuva lot of these left on TCG in general. You can't, for instance, pick your favorite basic art and conveniently buy 30 mountains. These aren't ever going to be reprinted with the same foiling process of the old days, and there will always be people looking to bling out their lands. As more old-border cards get printed, I think more players will want to ""match"" the rest of their deck and these will all disappear.",Rate My Spec - I'm trying to get better at MTGFinance!
"I purchased a collection of about 30k cards a month ago.  I knew exactly what I was buying, nothing old, and not much over $10(maybe 50 total cards over $10).  It was almost exclusively Throne of Eldrane, Theros: Beyond Death, and Core 2020.  It did have a decent sprinkling of Guilds of Ravnica and Ravnica Allegiances as well.  Much to my surprise and joy, and the bottom of one box was an eldrane box that had ""mystery"" written across it. It turned out to be an unsorted box of mystery boosters.  MC included!  That was a nice find.  So the collection ended up being about 4700 rares, 14-15,000 commons, 8-10,000 uncommons, and lots of lands and tokens.  There are a couple hundred foil lands, a few hundred foils, 1200 top loaders, so all in all it was a great buy for a grand.  It got me back into the MTG scene/game and it's been a blast sorting and finding little pockets of cool stuff(Veil of Summer! wow!).  I've pulled playsets of commons and uncommons for my playgroup, son, and myself.  I still have a LOT of bulk left lol...  I am a very patient person, and don't really want to just bulk it at $3/1,000.  So I thought I might hit you guys up for what you guys would do in my spot.  I appreciate any feedback from the sub.  This has been a great place to get back in the game and make smart decisions to grow my collection and the worth/value!","What do you guys do with bulk commons, uncommons, and sub $1 rares"
"So, just like last time with Retail boosters, I opened precisely one sealed case of Convention Boosters, 2021 edition.  I took all the cards from Slots 13, 14 and 15 and put each one into a Quicklist load.  First I did each one as the 'pictured' printing of the card (called 'original' in the spreadsheet).  Then I did the current Mystery Convention booster version of the card.

For the Playtest cards instead I did the original version of the card, with the Planeswalker symbol.  Then the second line is the non-PW Symbol version.  ALL of these prices are based off TCGPlayer Market Price with the card in LP condition.  

[IMPORTANT POINT] Since it's based off Market, and many of the non-PW symbol Playtest cards don't have a market value yet, please take the last line with a grain of salt currently.

Eventually I will put this information in a Google doc, but since there's only one data point right now, here it is...

Slot 13 - Original		                $715.00 
Slot 13 - Changed to Mystery		 $614.64 
Slot 14 - Original		               $1,017.97 
Slot 14 - Changed to Mystery		$969.59

Slot 15 - Changed to 2021	              $214.34 

Now, as I said in the original post on the subject, my case was VERY duplicate box filled.  Three boxes were almost exactly the same, 2 more were almost the same, and the last one was different.  Also, this completely ignores high value cards from the other slots.  Things like 3 Demonic Tutors and such.  Only slots 13, 14 and 15.

Initially I'll update this most days, eventually changes will slow down and I'll do them less often.

"It seems like every new set is 'one of the best selling sets ever'!

Kaldheim was the best winter set, despite being the bastard child of the Collector Booster era. AFR is another 'top selling' set despite having terrible EV and almost everyone posting lukewarm or negative thoughts on it. MH2 actually makes sense because it has fetches, is loaded with value and all kinds of fun Modern cards but it's still $200+/box.

So my question is literally, who is able to buy all of this product? These are the 'best selling sets' on top of the ton of commander products, Secret Lairs, supplementary products, Master's sets, and whatever else is being dumped lately. WotC has been producing more sets/cards in the last 2 years than ever before and many of these products are more expensive than typical standard sets.

Hasbro keeps saying that it's the 'casual player base' that makes most of their revenue, but most MTG players I know aren't that wealthy. I visit a few LGS in my area, and very few of the players are wealthy. They'll admit their Modern deck was their splurge purchase. They don't have money for optimal land bases in their EDH decks. They haven't been buying whole boxes every set.

I feel like the average MTG player is a blue/white collar worker bringing home 30-50k/yr. For full transparency, I make low 6-figures and can't even keep up with all the new products. I bought a little Strixhaven (CBs) and went pretty hard on MH2, but skipped every other standard set since Ikoria.

"Honestly...the recent Fortnite and Street Fighter Secret Lairs are kinda pushing me in the direction of selling out of this game. 

MTG has a rich history, its own lore. Seeing such collaborations is actually sad. The Walking Dead was already baffling, but now it seems like WOTC has really jumped the shark. 

At some point having different art for cards was frowned upon. Cards used to be memorable: you instantly knew what you were dealing with. Lightning Bolt is a great example with a very simple illustration. But what does [*that*](https://scryfall.com/card/sta/105/ja/lightning-bolt) evoke to you? And that's just an example out of many. 

I get that Secret Lairs and promos are bling. You can avoid them. But they still shouldn't cross with other IPs. 

I feel like Magic is slowly heading towards a path where it'll become a shadow of its former self. We already see the greed in full swing with an avalanche of products each quarter (seriously, trying to keep up with releases has become unsustainable). Now you're telling me some cards like Gandalf and fucking Warhammer might be played in Eternal formats? 

It truly feels like the beginning of the end. And that's a shame, because the actual real sets (not supplemental products or shitty crossovers) are still neat for the most part.",Anyone else feels like selling out of MTG altogether?
"AFR has seen drastically reduced allocations to most stores. There is one guy on here who claims to have received his full allocation and then some, maybe he has the extra thousand of boxes shorted elsewhere.


What we know is the prices have fallen during allocation period and collector boosters are still available at pre-order pricing or less depending on the seller.  New product prices are at multiple year lows for AFR. Multiple stores are unloading boxes at $80-$89 just to move what boxes they received.
Here’s one example if you want it https://www.prodigygamestcg.com/products/magic-the-gathering-adventures-in-the-forgotten-realm-draft-booster-box?variant=39404817940551&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=gs-2021-03-03&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=smart_campaign&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1JeJBhB9EiwAV612y-eKQhVigzIDF5TA7wGGDqNKNiY8_QAqoNHqN-nqtYBFP0BJ2CvIyxoCK_EQAvD_BwE.



Singles prices are squashed down towards the lower boundary and there has been some vocal backlash.

So when asked if WOTC learned anything from the failure of AFR, Mark Rosewater responded 

“Failure? Who’s causing it a failure? It’s looking to be one of the best-selling sets in the history of the game. I’ll officially call it “not a failure”.”

If we take Maro at his word and assume that Maro is comparing AFR to ALL previous sets including Kamigawa, Shards, Rise, Oath, NYX, Theros, Zen, Innistrad… blocks… then he is technically correct.

Sales are at all time highs across all products and print runs are much higher, but shitting your pants in an Armani suit instead of a Men’s Wearhouse garb doesn’t make it any better.

I would like to point that simply using the excuse that because sales as a whole are higher now that redefines failure into success is broken logic that will lead us down a fraught path.

I hope there is some additional supporting responses to come that allow WOTC to learn from the multitude of errors in releasing AFR as is.",Redefining failure for AFR

\---------------------------------------------------------------

My thoughts on these have been scattered across numerous comments over the past few days, so I'm gonna organize them all here because I have enough to say to fill a post.

**Convention Boosters**

***These are rare.*** 

Consensus seems to be that stores that have held drafts generally got a number between a dozen and eightyish, for a distributor price of about $120 per box. Stores that don't host drafts or FNM likely didn't get anything. Listings on TCGPlayer have been hovering around 45 boxes for a couple days now (compare to the 70 something Retail boxes on TCGPlayer at close to the same price, although those are moving much slower). 

Distributors are saying there is one wave, and this is it. There is no indication that WOTC will print more of these down the line. They themselves state that this is a limited release, and it's pretty obvious that this reprint is basically to bring the total number of convention boosters (2019 + 2021) to what it would've been had the 2020 convention circuit gone uninterrupted and unCOVIDed. The intent appears to be to just make up for unprinted boxes from 2020 and finally get the intended supply out in the wild, whether conventions are actually running or not. 

A significant number of these were or are going to be drafted or cracked - stores were encouraged to hold drafts on or near release, and a large number folks surely bought these specifically to draft with their buddies (it is a well-regarded draft environment after all). That significantly reduces the supply of circulating sealed boxes. Who knows how many were or are destined to be drafted, but it's food for thought. Sealed boxes are probably gonna disappear.

***These have buying pressure, but also localized uncertainty?***

Box prices are currently a bit under $300 shipped on TCGPlayer. Prices vary wildly across LGSes - some are selling for as low as or lower than $200 a box, some are charging $20/pack, some are just hoarding them for the moment. Online deals can be had if you're very attentive and can find medium-ish sized stores that have an online sales platform.

Convention boxes and Retail boxes both have very similar market prices at the moment (\~$290 vs $280). Expected Value from the Playtest slot is significantly higher than the Retail version's foil slot (of which half is pure-or-near bulk, with nothing that hits as hard as the two big Slivers), however the loss of Rhystic Study, Mother of Runes, Essence Warden, Dismember, Nature's Lore, et al does hurt. While those were replaced with some decent cards (Sakashima, Priest of Titania, Aura of Silence), it's still definitely an EV loss overall in the non-playtest/foil department (though how much I don't know exactly). Plus we don't yet know how much of an impact being double-printed will have on these replacement cards' value (maybe not a ton as the print run is still low, but it's probably non-negligible). With all that said, though, it's my belief that the sheer scarcity and uniqueness of these boxes, as well as the playtest EV being much higher than foil EV, will do a lot of heavy lifting in raising convention box prices in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**Playtest Cards**

***These are rare.***

With 121 different cards in the playtest card slot, your chances of pulling any one particular card from a box is about 1 in 5. For perspective, (completely guessing that) if there are around 100,000 boxes in this reprint (assuming that there are 6,000 WPN stores that got allocated an average of about 17 boxes each, or roughly three cases), there are 20,000 copies of each playtest card printed. That's a bit more than Unlimited rares, of which 16,000 of each exist, and about as many as the 19,300 English Legends rares (for the record, both of these sets had 117 and 121 rares respectively, so that also lines up nicely). Even if there were 500,000 boxes printed (very unlikely), you'd have a run of test cards lower than The Dark rares (which isn't exactly a little, but it's not into-the-ground).

***These are not tournament legal, which hurts demand, but they still appeal to several kinds of Magic nerd.***

There are four main groups that will drive prices for these singles: Collectors, cubers, liberal EDH brewers, and speculators. Each has different wants, but you can generally expect that as a whole, they'll be going particularly for the most playable cards, and any cards that might be dirt cheap. More on those below. There is also the secret fifth group of people who are just sitting on these (whether singles or sealed), not really knowing what to do with them yet, removing supply from circulation indefinitely. 

How hard each group goes on these, I can't say. It may be the case that since these are available outside convention hotspots, awareness of them goes up and that corresponds to relatively higher demand than there might be otherwise. Supply is also scattered much more evenly across the globe and across less die-hard Magic fans (that is, those who may never go to a convention or route these to an online marketplace), and that may affect the velocity and price of these cards.

***On the cards themselves.***

I decided to use [the same spreadsheet as my RL analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qjHcHjw2CDYTcnUrFoT9huwJrHD6p_Z5bdkXcTlz3sc/edit?usp=sharing) to go over all of these. This is where a good chunk of my time went for this post, so scroll to the bottom to find my takes on each of them!

**These aren't likely to be reprinted.**

Mark Rosewater is quoted as being unhappy with the playtest cards, saying they don't live up to Magic quality standards. They're also clearly divisive among folks here and elsewhere, who'd prefer the Retail version's foils if Mystery Boosters return in numbers. WOTC is almost definitely aware of this and won't likely reprint them over something more marketable to a broader audience (nor do I think it's in their best interest to screw over the value of these as limited collectibles). A Secret Lair of a selection of these with proper art may be in the cards, but seems pretty unlikely when they could just print something more widely appealing (and playable, and profitable). That'd probably be something \*super\* limited for Hascon or whatever. Personally, I think this is all there is for Mystery Boosters, particularly with the jam-packed product schedule revealed to us today. We'll most likely just see Mystery Booster 2, if anything, such that WOTC can conserve some reprint equity for all the cards printed in these so far.

**What I'm doing**

I ordered three boxes for an average of $280 or so (one to crack, one to draft, one to sit on for a bit), and once playtest cards begin to bottom out I'll snatch up what I want for my collection. I think boxes will appreciate rapidly beyond their EV in the relatively near future, as they're gonna get cracked pretty fast, the print run is small, LGSes will run out quickly, and sealed product will get locked up in closets for the future either for drafts or ebay.

"Hello everyone. Thank you all for all the support for these in-depth Secret Lair posts! The idea of this is to help players figure out whether or not certain Secret Lairs are worth as well as to track how previous Secret Lairs are doing.

This is strictly looking at the financial side and not a discussion about how players feel about the Secret Lair product line as a whole.

I want to point out that if you are planning on buying Secret Lairs to resell, be aware of the shipping costs and seller fees. A $30 Secret Lair can be sold for $50 on ebay, but after shipping and fees, you likely will have barely made a profit. In addition, you also likely had to pay tax+shipping on top of the sticker price when you initially bought the product.

# Newbie's Guide to Purchasing Secret Lairs

Here's a quick guide to decide whether or not a Secret Lair is for you. The golden rule is to use the same principles that you use for buying singles when you are buying Secret Lairs.

Ask yourself the following question: need or greed? Do you NEED this product, aka, are you going to actively play with the cards or are you trying to collect all of the Secret Lair products? This is different from GREED, aka, are you trying to buy this so you can either sell it later or because you fear the prices will go up so you want to get in now? If you are the former, then you should probably get the product; if it's the latter, I recommend not getting it.

Foil versions don't really carry a premium over the nonfoil versions, so it should your own personal preference on which version you want.

Secret Lairs are a decent investment as long as you have the means to move singles. It's not recommended to sell them Sealed unless you absolutely have to.

# August Secret Lairs

For all of the prices listed below, I will be using TCG Low. The price taken will be the cheapest NM or LP card and is the Price+Shipping total. I am also using the cheapest version of the card. If a Secret Lair is in foil only (there are none in the new Secret Lairs), I still will be using the cheapest nonfoil version of the card for the price, provided that the nonfoil variant is the cheapest version of said card. Prices will be rounded to the nearest $0.1 if the card is &lt;$1; otherwise it will be rounded to the nearest $0.25.

Unlike the last batch of Lairs, there is no one Lair that is absolutely stuffed with value. Other than the Thomax Baxa one, all of these Lairs at least break even when looking at the singles prices.

There are two key standouts in this batch that those who are looking to make a profit should be eyeing. The first one is the old-bordered Planeswalker one. In addition to being the first old-bordered Planeswalkers, the rules text is also written out so that it follows the old format of rules text. However, I am not singling this one out because of it's gimmick; in fact, I think we can expect Wizards to start using this format when they do release old-bordered Planeswalkers. No, the reason why it's a standout is because all 3 cards in the Lair are &gt;$10, which means there will be demand for these cards, gimmick or not. This makes this Lair a very safe option for those who are investing because none of these cards are duds.

The second one, which is the one I will be picking up the most of, is the Kamigawa Ink Secret Lair. The value is there, the art is amazing, and it's all filled with Legendary Creatures. Up until the previous Superdrop, it's has been quite a while before Wizards has released an all Legendary Creature Lair. It would've been better if we had more commonly used Commanders in this Lair, but this checks off everything on my list for a Lair that will go up quickly.

As always, picking up a bundle will give you a decent discount. This discount will severely help those who plan to flip and should factor into your decision on whether not you are buying it.

As always, if you want to play with any of these cards, then buy them. If you don't and don't have a good way of flipping these, don't buy them. 

# Previous Secret Lairs

I also want to go over some of the more recent Secret Lairs and see how they are performing. I think there are some interesting trends to be seen.

For each of these Lairs, I will show the following:

1. Initial (when the SL was first announced) combined price of the cheapest nonfoil version of the singles
2. Combined price of the cheapest nonfoil version of the singles.
3. Combined price of the Secret Lair variant of the singles. If there is a nonfoil/foil version, I will show both.
4. TCGPlayer price of a Sealed Secret Lair. If there is a nonfoil/foil version, I will show both. Easier to look up than eBay and they're pretty similar, so I made the switch.
5. I will also now show the change from the last Superdrop to the current Superdrop. If you want to see the older price histories, please check out my previous posts. Won't be color coding them since it'd be way too much work.

Prices given will be TCG Low. The bonus card, unless otherwise stated, is not included in the price analysis.

The Smitten Superdrop is shipping out soon. I'll update this post at the beginning of September with the prices there; until then, they will remain on the Pending list.

*Dog Lair continues to move up while the other are slowly dropping in price.* 

*The Prime Slime Secret Lair Singles are falling in price even though the regular versions of the cards are moving up in value. There is a large multiplier on the Secret Lair versions, so maybe it's not too surprising.*

*After appreciating in our last period, this Lair has seen a drop in prices, especially the nonfoil versions of the cards. The regular versions of these cards have been sliding in price since the Secret Lair released, which may indicate that it's possible the additional supply of the Secret Lair cards may finally be impacting the card price.*

*Only 1 Swamp is factored into the price here; the bonus Swamp wasn't factored in.*

*Nonfoils are going down while the foil versions are increasing. The same holds for the Sealed Lairs. We may see the foil versions continue to increase, likely because of the Swamp.*

*Foil singles of the lands are significantly less than the Sealed ones, leading me to believe that a lot of supply has been cracked. This Lair has been quite disappointing in terms of movement, likely because the supply is so huge.*

*MTGA code volume has completely stopped and I will likely stop tracking this.*

*The squirrel Secret Lair continues it's meteoric rise despite the regular versions dropping in price. This is likely being fueled by Chatterfang EDH players. Not sure if how more room there for this to keep climbing as demand starts lowering for these cards.*

*Party Hard, once the strongest of the Lairs, has fallen hard. I thought this was a good one to pick up, but Assassin's Trophy has seen a big drop in price. Still not a bad Lair, just not as strong as it was.*

*We are seeing retracements on all of the Secretversary Secret Lairs now. Other than the Squirrel one, the others have seen a decrease in prices. It's likely that demand has died down due to players all getting their copies and there is now a glut of supply.*

*The Secret Lair Sol Ring has a huge multiplier on it and Teferi doesn't have much of a premium on it here. Prices have dropped a gooda mount, but the Sealed versions are holding steadily. Likely just a correction as the Singles price fall to be more in line with the Sealed price.*

# Pending Secret Lairs

We'll track the singles prices on Secret Lairs which have not shipped yet as well. Won't really comment on anything here, but it might be useful for those players who are awaiting their Secret Lairs and who are interested in the market movement of cards.

I will not be displaying any other prices until they are released.

# Final Words

For this batch of Secret Lairs, my picks are the Kamigawa Ink and the Teferi's Time Trouble Lairs. Kamigawa Ink because it has great art and Legendary Creatures, and Teferi's Time Trouble because of the consistent value of the 3 cards inside.

There was a lot of discussion in my previous post and Secret Lairs are generally profitable as you can easily crack them and sell as Singles; this will be the main way players can profit on the Secret Lairs. In addition, there are Lairs where there is an opportunity for arbitrage where the Singles price greatly exceeds the Sealed price.

We're starting to see a lot of patterns emerge from the increased ordering windows. On release Secret Lair prices will quickly increase as players who didn't buy the full Secret Lairs pick up the Singles they want. After a period of time, however, demand goes down and the prices of the cards go down and stay stagnant. If you look at the price histories of all the Lairs, you can see a trend.

The key question remains, how do we separate the winners from the losers? You have to look at which cards will continue to have demand past the initial spike after release as well as whether or not the cards will continue to be reprinted with more bling variants. As mentioned above, I look for unique art and cards that can be your Commander as Commander cards generally have the highest percentage of players that will want to bling out said card. There is another trend that is emerging as well: cute tribal Secret Lairs. It's no secret that the OMG KITTIES is one of the best performing Secret Lairs ever. If we look back, the Dog Secret Lair, while not too crazy, continues to hold value and the Faerie one is picking up steam as well. There is another Lair announced for Pulse Con that I expect will do very well, but also because of it's limited availability in addition to the Cat theme.

Always keep in mind supply and demand. If a lot of people anticipate a Lair to be a hit or a sleeper hit, you should stay away from those Lairs as there will be increased supply. The prime example for this is Happy Little Gathering.

As usual, let me know what you think and what you plan on picking up. Any feedback is always welcome!",In-Depth Financial Analysis on the August 2021 Secret Lairs + Review of Previous Secret Lairs

"If you haven't been living under a rock, everyone knows that the enemy fetchland printing in MH2 has really dropped their prices to levels not seen since their original printing. 

In magic, there are few guarantees, but when it comes to fetchlands, they always go back up. Look at the prices of friendly colors currently if you need evidence of that. 

The question people are struggling with now, is ""When do I buy?"" And it's a legitimate one. 

When a new set releases you have an ebb and flow of singles pricing that almost always follows a pattern(outside of a card that spikes because of a new deck or synergy). 

Right now fetches(base versions, not extended art or retro) seem to be at an extended low pricing for the past couple weeks. I have been watching them and they are all staying pretty steady currently, but this will definitely change and in the future there is nearly no doubt these lands will be nearly double the price they are currently. 

As long as MH2 is being printed(set and drafts boosters) it should keep the price depressed. But we know Wizards can sometimes just pull the plug without warning. 

Current pricing is probably one of the best entry points on enemy fetches, but realize you will have to have that money tied up until they start to climb again and plan on when you want to unload your position.",Let's talk about enemy fetchlands
"In the last 2 years I've been collecting a lot of the new shiny full arts foils from collectors editions, double masters and other premium products. And they have appreciated really well, like expected.

In Europe the growth usually stops at 50-60 EUR for premium cards (personal observation). 

So my question is, will the market start grading these premium full art foils and push their prices even higher? 

I'm comparing the MTG market with the Pokemon market, where grading is very common and I wonder if grading a \[\[Mox Opal\]\] from Double Masters VIP will ever become a thing and will collectors chase high grades for these cards? A high grade could easily push the current price 2-5x with a high grade.

My thesis is that they will be graded, because they are beautiful enough to be displayed in a slab, but I could very well be wrong. So whats your opinion on the premium cards that we've got in the last few years? Will grading and collecting them for display purposes be the next catalyst for future growth? Or will they be stuck at a 'play-ability' glass ceiling until the next premium version arrives?",Will grading ever become a thing for modern MTG cards like other TCG are experiencing?

"I was discussing grading in a comment on another thread, but wanted a post to discuss the most accepted way to take photos to show a card at its best but not be deceiving.

It seems the background, light source and positioning can really expose the sides of a card which can make it seem like it is worn but isn't.  The sides of brand new cards are white and if you shine a light from the side and have a background that can reflect that, it will look like a worn edge along the sides.

see these pics of my Lion's Eye Diamond

[https://imgur.com/a/Uys0U9b](https://imgur.com/a/Uys0U9b)

There is really on a few scuffs but looking at the card with the black cloth background with a lamp shining from the top left it looks like a worn edge. But that same situation doesn't show that white glare on the right and bottom edge.

"In early July I amassed a significant amount of CK credit and have since been buying various cards, including RL cards in the $50-1000 range, checking CK's stock literally every day.  By doing so I've been able to make some informal observations with regard to their inventory.

I'll put each card into one of six categories, or in some cases between two categories (i.e., a .5 rating) because the card didn't exactly fit in one category.  Here's an explanation of the categories:

Category 1 - The card is never (or almost never) in stock, or if it's in stock then it's always sold out within 24 hours

Category 2 - The card is in stock from time to time, and, when so, is almost always sold out within 24 hours unless they put multiple copies up for sale at once

Category 3 - The card is in stock on a pretty regular basis but usually sold out within 24-48 hours unless they put multiple copies up for sale at once

Category 4 - The card is in stock on a regular basis and, when so, usually is available for 48+ hours even if just one or two copies are put up for sale at once

Category 5 - The card is always available in multiple copies, and, although copies do appear to selling, it's never or almost never been sold out

Category 6 - The card is always available in multiple copies and few if any sales seem to be occurring, although I can't be 100% sure since perhaps some are being sold but replaced by other copies

Note that I did this only for non-ABUR or Four Horsemen sets, as those weren't what I was targeting at this time.  Here are my observations, alphabetically by set and by card name:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Alliances - Lake of the Dead (Category 2), Helm of Obedience (Category 3)

Exodus - City of Traitors (Category 2), Survival of the Fittest (Category 1), Hatred (Category 3), Mind Over Matter (Category 6), Recurring Nightmares (Category 2)

As promised we will continue to update and support this document. Thank you for all the feedback from last month's post. We apologize for the color scheme as that was what seemed to be most unappealing to many.

Here's the [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FZdQ-1Inne3L311PfJUoC-Wmr-8P_781UbhJ-1alDUY/edit?usp=sharing) again for those who didn't save it. 

We also added two additional pages to simply show if the net increased, decreased, or stayed the same. As always feel free to come to your own conclusions from this data. Thanks everyone and have a great one.

Now for a quick run down on the numbers

1.) This is your net profit after fee's and shipping. Not including any sales tax. Take that into account that your specific ROI will vary though this should get you in the ballpark.

2.) Color scheme;
Red = Any profit loss
Light green = 0 to 20%
Lime green = 20% to 50%
Dark green = 50% to 100%
Blue = 100%+

3.) Singles ROI is an average on non-direct and direct sale. And when we add in bonus cards we take the average net of all the possible cards then average that against direct versus non-direct as well. If you sell non-direct only best suggestion is to take off about 10% off that average and vice-versa for direct only sellers.

In total i purchased 98 non foil copies (NM:28, LP:66, MP:3, HP:1) and 23 Foil copies (NM:10, LP:9, MP: 4) I purchased the non foil copies in a range of 0.10 to 0.44 and the foil copies in a range of 0.5 to 1.20.  
In total it cost me 42.33 + 6.08 in shipping.   
I started selling them on tcgplayer and ended up selling 17 copies making about $68. I was able to save so money on shipping the cards out as I have pretty large stock of stamps and PWE.

All in all I made $314.87. Looking back selling it was very unrealistic to sell the foils at the heavily inflated price and if i were to do it again in the future I would just be expecting to buylist the majority of the cards as its a bit unrealistic for the card to boom in demand.

"Hello everyone,

when MH1 spoilers came out and **Archmage's Charm** was revealed, I was immediately hooked, while others were very skeptical and doubted its potential. As we all know today, the card is an absolute Modern staple and arguably one of the top 3 counterspells that we've ever seen in the format, which is also reflected by its current price tag (\~$15). For a very long time span, this card could be had for under $1 despite its potential, and I don't think I have to tell you what that means in terms of financial gains for those who were brave enough to build a sizeable position at these low prices.

When I look at MH2, I believe that there is a card in the set, namely **Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar (Asmo)**, that could follow the same price history in the not so distant future. Even though these cards seem very different at first glance, I feel like they share some commonalities that should not be overlooked, as they might hint at a very similar trajectory.

&amp;#x200B;

* Price development during spoiler season

When Archmage's Charm was first revealed, you could preorder the card for a few dollars, just like it is common for most rares which are listed at inflated prices during spoiler season. What's interesting is that the card spiked to \~$30 before the set was released, because some people apparantly identified the potential of the card and felt that it was underpriced during preorders (a very uncommon scenario which is **almost never** true). Right after the set was released the price crashed very significantly, and for 6 months the card was up for grabs at \~$1 before it spiked to $4-5, where it stayed for one year before it finally spiked to today's prices.

If we compare Asmo to Archmage's Charm, we can see the exact same price development. Preorders started relatively low until people saw the potential, it spiked to \~$30 before the set was released, and it crashed to \~$1 after release, which is where we are at right now.

Some people seemed to understand that Archmage's Charm was a strong and format defining card during preorders, which is why they were willing to pay $30 for the card. Today, we know that they were right (about the strength of the card, not about buying at these prices) and I am convinced that the people who bought Asmo for $30 also evaluated the potential of the card correctly, even if they almost assuredly overpaid.

&amp;#x200B;

* Versatility

When it comes to Archmage's Charm, I don't want to state the obvious. The card has three modes, all of them do different, yet equally powerful things depending on the situation and the state of the game. The card is basically the definition of versatility. Since Modern is such a multisided format, it is very beneficial for cards to be versatile in order to be successful. 

While Asmo does not have three different modes, I believe that it is equally versatile in different ways. It **enables different play styles** and different **strategies**. The card can be an aggro card (see Vengevine / Hollow One decks) without focusing too much on the food plan, it can be a midrange card that enables atrifact strategies (see Urza's Kitchen decks), it can be used to enable the food plan (see BG Food decks), I have even seen some people play it in BW Stoneblade / Taxes decks, using Aether Vial to put it into play on turn 1. If a card can be played in many different decks and synergizes well with all of them, you should definitely sit up and take notice.

Another feature that often does not get enough credit is that both cards are / can be **card neutral,** which means that they replace themselves and leave you with the same amount of cards in hand. Draw 2, of course, is even card positive, but Asmo is still card neutral by putting The Underworld Cookbook in your hand. Remember when Jeskai Lotus Field was a deck in Modern? I am sure if Blood Sun didn't replace itself, it wouldn't have been nearly as popular / successful. When good cards don't generate card disadvantage, things get interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

* Why people are / were skeptical

Archmage's Charm's **UUU mana cost** seemed to bother people. Many thought that it would be too much of a hassle to make the card castable on turn 3. Regardless, today the card is a staple in 3c decks and people seem to have no issues whatsoever with casting the card regularly on turn 3.

Solution: Tap UUU and cast the card. No rocket science. 

Asmo has casting restrictions, too, as you have to discard a card first before you can actually cast the card. I agree that this is a big deal, but I also believe that there is a plethora of cards that enable Asmo while **advancing the decks game plan** at the same time.

Solution: Street Wraith is card neutral and can basically be played in any deck. You have 4 Cookbooks that enable Asmo. In decks like Hollow One or Vengevine, cards like Cathartic Reunion, Goblin Lore and Burning Inquiry advance your game plan while enabling Asmo. Use Aether Vial to put it into play on turn 1. I've actually tried this approach myself and I have to say that Asmo Taxes decks look very promising. I hope that people start looking into this archetype, as it seems to be very underrated at the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Appearance in the Modern format after set release

People started playing Archmage's Charm very early and experimented with it, despite most of the community saying that it was ""unplayable"". I think I first saw it in Delver and Urza lists, then UW Control decks caught up, and over the course of a few months every blue deck played at least a few copies of the card.

I saw people come up with Asmo lists during spoiler season and called the card ""busted"" before it was even part of the format. As stated above, many different strategies in various color combinations are built around Asmo, and players are still expermenting with different shells. The card is very prominent in the format and puts up great results from time to time. Once the meta game settles and gets ""figured out"", I expect Asmo to be a Modern staple, especially when creature decks have a high meta share. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Conclusion

I believe that the card is too cheap for how popular it is and what it does. Some people even compare it to Punishing Fire, and while I think that this is a little far-fetched, I can kind of relate to that. Remember, Punishing Fire is banned in Modern because it shuts down creature decks, and I think that's exactly what Asmo does in addition to the synergy it has with artifact decks in general and presenting a respectable clock. 

In my opinion, this card should be nowhere near the $1 price tag and I don't think that it will stay there very long. What baffles me the most is how dirt cheap etched foils are. They look great, they don't curl and they are so much rarer than the regular version. Etched foils are the real deal, but I understand that this is probably a matter of taste.

Since they have not been produced for some years now it is difficult to gauge a fair price.

"I wanted to know what the community would have done in this case - I contacted a seller on the local FB group that wanted to sell his Boros Burn deck as a whole.

He insisted they were in very good condition (""some NM and most EX"" he said), I asked for photos and he said he was in class and that we could meet at a local store later. 

I made an offer for 400 dollars for the lot, which seemed fair based on what CardKingdom has for the cards, maybe a bit on the high side even? (opinions wanted :) ) - first warning should have been that he said ""I put everything on the calculator and it gave me 500! This is already the lowest I'm willing to go"" - yeah, for NM everything, and I'd rather buy from Cardkingdom then.

I went to the store, and started unsleeving the fetchlands first. They showed signs of heavy play, but the deal breaker was a crease / bend in the middle (maybe from excessive shuffling, or bending when shuffling or something). EVERY card had the same wear / crease and bend pattern. I showed him the creases and he said ""yes I played the deck extensively, but it's normal wear, they're EX"", I told him there was no way the cards were worth what he was asking for and backed out of the purchase.

Would you have pushed more heavily for the seller to make a discount / argue with them? Or is it better to just back from the purchase?

"I'm looking at the ~300 price point for the 2021 Mystery booster box and trying to understand where this price is coming from.
I opened a retail box of Mystery booster from last years release and got absolutely fantastic pulls, even considering the ~$150 I paid for the box (they were $100 on release). From what I can tell, this release is essentially the same, but also includes the convention Playtest cards in addition to the usual 2 rares in each pack. 

Do the playtest cards really justify tripling the price of the box? Are 24 playtest cards really worth $200? Or are we just conditioned to be OK spending this kind of money on a specialty box after MH2 and double masters, or suffering from FOMO due to the last Mystery Boosters tragically small run?

"Aside from perhaps to post on a youtube channel where the possible monetization will compensate for some if not all of the cost of the pack, I am lost as to why people are still cracking individual MTG booster packs that cost $100+.

Even if you can guarantee the packs have not been searched or mapped, and are not leftover packs where big money cards from the box have already been pulled - all big ifs - the chances of making back your money is so small.

It used to be that even if you didn't pull a top card you could send your pack fresh stuff for grading in hopes of making back the cost of the pack.  But as I alluded to in my last post, grading fees have gone way up, likely for good, making it so that strategy is seemingly no longer viable.

And to be clear, I'm not talking about buying packs to save for posterity, to send for grading (the packs themselves, not the cards), and/or to try and resell later.  I mean buying them to open......now.  And I'm also talking about packs costing $100+, where for most if not all of the applicable sets the chances of pulling cards that make your back your money is less - perhaps substantially less - than 5%, and again that assumes a level playing field of unsearched/unmapped/unlooted packs.

"In looking over the announcement for mystery booster convention edition that was in the main Reddit just now, I saw this which I didn’t remember seeing before: “Note: Mystery Booster cards typically include a small printing of the Planeswalker symbol in the lower left corner, similar to what you see in cards from The List found in Set Boosters. While this was the case for all cards in the original printing of Mystery Booster: Convention Edition, in this printing going to WPN stores the Planeswalker symbol will not appear on the Playtest cards.”

So all the old playtest cards can be differentiated from the new ones about to drop, since the old ones have the planeswalker symbol in the left lower corner. This is pretty interesting as that kind of acts like a first edition marker. Did I just miss that part before? Feels pretty big to me",1st edition mystery booster playtest cards

"According To Mark Rosewater There Will Be No More None MtG Setting Premiere Sets, Will The Value Of AFR Spike?

 So no more D&amp;D sets in Standard after AFR is done. Could this lead to a long term spike in value for the set as its a one of a kind,super unique, never to be repeated in any form set now? I mean alot of folks assumed there would be alot more D&amp;D Standard sets going forth, until this.

 Personally I think The Forgotten Realms and other D&amp;D settings are more suited to a Commander Legends set then Standard Sets (preferably with Arena tie set like MH1&amp;2 are getting and Jumpstart got,), FR has tons of characters begging to be Legendary Creatures and Planeswalkers, and FR has different regions that could pull in all kinds of mechanics, Embalm for Mulhorandi Mummies, Devotion for Chessenta, Historic including Sagas to to explore FRs history in addition to the dice role mechanic and Venture into the Dungeons (with stronger dungeons).

 So will AFR cards and sealed products spike in value, now or a few years from now?","According to Mark Rosewater there will be No Morr None MtG Setting Premiere Sets, Will the value of AFR spike?"
"As sportscards, pokemon and MTG cards exploded in value and popularity, grading card companies such as PSA and BGS were inundated to such an extent that even after raising prices and lengthening turn around time, they both still had enough of a backlog to pause their lower end options.  Although the markets for all these cards has softened, grading companies have not returned to how they used to operate in terms of either turn around time or cost.

With cost unlikely to ever go back to the bulk rate of $10-12 per card, it seems like there is an excellent buying opportunity for low priced slabs, meaning ones $50-100 or so, from the oldest sets.  Why?  Because they're already slabbed, proving their authenticity and grade, plus future copies are less likely to be graded because the value isn't there anymore if the card isn't worth hundreds of dollars.  As such, population reports for these cards could stay low, theoretically making them more valuable to collectors.  Yes, I realize that the buying pool is smaller for slabbed cards because you can't play them; however, for the most part these are not staple cards, but rather low end four horsemen stuff, revised, unlimited, and still even some beta.

I have received nearly all of my credit. I did send one last order in after i was sorting what i had left and i found some cards I also didnt really need any more. I then used deckbox.org to input all of my remaining cards so i would know the rough value of my cards. Deckbox does tend to skew a bit higher, on average 10% or so i would estimate.

I have received $4728.86 in credit so far. And i used all of it as well as $5.85 to purchase one of each dual land i was missing (all except scrubland and Tundra). As well as all of the fetches i was missing to complete my playset of 5 each (one for commander and 4 for constructed play). I did purchase a few really cheap cards to fill out my Seb McKennon foil collection as well, the total on those was less than $10.00.

When I started I had 48,972 cards in my Deckbox collection worth $52,087.33 or $1.06 per card. After sending off over 90% of my collection, Deckbox is showing my collection of 4,620 cards is now worth $40,206.80, or $8.70 per card. These numbers mean I gave up 90.57% of my cards and only gave up 22.81% of my value.

Overall I am very happy with the outcome, with the exception of the last order that they have yet to receive i only lost 6.09% of the value off NM due to grading. I am actively trying to acquire as little bulk as possible. The last two FNMs i went to gave out the promo packs, i only kept one card from each and gave away the rest.

"Hello Everyone,

I've been buying and selling cards at CK for over 7 years. Recently their process of Grading cards and selling cards of NM have been degrading the past few years from my experience.

In short, 20-30 percent of the cards that they sell in NM condition, in my recent big purchases, have been undoubtingly LP. Scuffs, nicks, smudging, etc.

Conversely, I have a lot of NM cards that I have purchased from them, kept in my collection without play, then re-sold a couple months later, and they were graded as LP, or in my worst case, MP.

I decided to put this to the test last week. I have a NM Breeding Pool expedition and a NM Temple Garden that I picked up from CK a few months ago. I told them to return the cards if they were under NM in the grading process. What do you know, both were graded LP! Both are being returned to me.

I understand no company is perfect, but this has caused me to move on to selling my singles on Ebay. I have had this same experience consistently for the past 6 months. Convenience doesn't overcome the financial loss.

I've been thinking about this for awhile and hopefully y'all have some insight into it.  Personally I have seen several fakes now that I wouldn't be able to tell without a tool to check.

But until recent years this was relatively hard to do.

"[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/o4ju1b/mh2_trajectories_assorted_thoughts_62021/) (which is the topic of today's post).

Standard disclaimer: This is entirely my opinion, I could be completely wrong about any of this, I play a card game like it's the stock market.

\---------------------------------------------------------------

Today I'll be reviewing my [MH2 predictions from a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/o4ju1b/mh2_trajectories_assorted_thoughts_62021/), during release weekend. Not everything, just the interesting bits. Here we go!

&gt;Here's what I see happening for MH2's future  
&gt;  
&gt;Amazon and MVP boxes get delivered in a couple days. This is where the dead cat bounce (which I believe we're currently in) starts seeing the effects of gravity, so to speak, and prices drop for a lot of stuff.

[Close but no](https://www.mtgstocks.com/sets/363-modern-horizons-2). The bounce happened a bit over a week after release, and came back down to earth about a month later.

&gt;...Forgotten Realms spoilers begin, and hype shifts from MH2 over to that. Folks chase the new shiny, demand for MH2 goes down, and prices go down even further for a majority of cards.

Subverted by the fact that Forgotten Realms was severely underwhelming, which couldn't really have been predicted. 

* Fetches

&gt;Price memory is a hell of a thing, and as EV goes down, these probably won't be the ones to suffer nearly as much. If you're buying anything MH2 right now, these are very safe bets - they're likely soaking up EV from a bunch of other cards going down.

Pretty accurate. Their prices now look only slightly lower than they did on release weekend.

* Yavimaya

&gt;It's seeing Modern/Legacy play as a one-of, which is promising, and is riding off the coattails of Urborg, but as EDH is concerned, there aren't nearly as many Forests-matter effects as Swamps-matter. I'm thinking it could dip lower.

Dip lower it did. The average went down from $18 to $10, although this could be said about a lot of MH2.

* Ragavan

&gt;He's amazing - poggers, even - and goes into a ton of decks, but I think he might be temporarily coming down from $70. Call it a gut feeling with the dead cat bounce and Fetches having yet to soak up all the EV I think they will from mythics.

Maybe briefly correct, but very briefly. Ragavan was around $50 for a little while after writing, and then stayed very consistent at $70, being a playset inclusion in just about every red deck that could play him.

* Most of the Enchantments-matter cards

&gt;Probably coming down in the next few weeks. They're all good, but pretty narrow. Sythis in particular doesn't currently justify being more than some of the good broader-yet-cheaper cards like Persist and Out of Time (although I can imagine a future where enchantress is a viable Modern deck). Nettlecyst might go up from where it's at, though. It's pretty cool and appeals to two different archetypes at once, with no color restrictions.

Correct. Sythis, Sanctum Weaver, and Presence all went down in the following weeks. Sterling Grove was slightly more resilient but still went down a bit. Nettlecyst stayed pretty consistent.

* Dakkon and Geyadrone

&gt;Dakkon is pretty much completely outclassed by T3feri in the vast majority of decks. I think he's easily the weakest of the three walkers in the set. Geyadrone is pretty clearly a Commander card. I think it's possible their value goes down further, being gobbled up by Fetches.

I underestimated how hard they'd drop - they're now about a dollar each. Nobody's playing these (although I like Geyadrone significantly more than Dakkon).

* Grist

&gt;The one possibly viable walker in the set. It's loyalty abilities aren't anything too special, but being able to Unearth and CoCo it is novel, and it dodges Negates. It's also a cute Commander. I'm not exactly down on it, but I don't really know that it can stay above $10.

Grist put up a better fight than the other two walkers, but still halved in value down to $5. Might be a decent spec for the future, but for now, nothing's really able to take great advantage of it.

* Most Suspend cards, Academy Manufactor, Diamond Lion, Chitterspitter, Squirrel Mob, Charmaw, Kavu, Carth, Garth, Zabaz, Lonis, Dockhand...

&gt;I fully expect these to tank to pure or near-bulk status. They're just too narrow and/or stone unplayable to not have their value sucked up even more by fetches. Resurgent Belief and Profane Tutor might hold their heads up above the water because they're Suspend 2 (I think Cascade decks are just gonna stick with Living End or Footfalls, meaning I'm expecting a couple commander decks to actually just suspend these). Kavu could possibly find a home in some 4/5C deck that mostly just wants a cheap beater with gravy. Manufactor could actually do some weird combo stuff but that's way above my head. That said, realistically I can't foresee the conditions being right for most of these.

Pretty spot-on aside from Manufactor, which saw significant demand from AFR-borne EDH treasure decks and has started to rise, and Profane Tutor, which has some big casual EDH appeal I guess? The rest went to bulk or near-bulk, as predicted (I feel for anyone who's pulled Garth). I don't dislike Kavu, Lonis, Charmaw, Chitterspitter, and Resurgent Belief at bulk prices, but the rest are pretty hard sells for me even now.

* Svyelun, Chatterfang, Kaldra, Murktide Regent, Scion of Draco

&gt;These mythics are played, but I'm thinking they're gonna have to come down given how narrow they are, once Fetches start soaking up value. Chatterfang especially only has Commander appeal.

Very wrong on Regent, a little wrong on Kaldra, and correct on the others. Regent ended up being a staple of Izzet decks in Modern and Legacy alike. Kaldra ended up being a one-of in Stoneforge decks which was enough to keep it from tanking, but it still went down about 40%. The others, especially Svyelun, halved or worse.

* Persist

&gt;I've been snatching up all of these that I could pick up in stacks for close to $1.25 or lower, mostly the sketch versions that folks aren't really paying attention to. It's among the better single-target reanimation spells out there, IMO only really worse than Reanimate, Animate Dead, and maybe Necromancy. It's starting to go back up at time of writing, but I think it's possible it may dip again during the dead cat bounce's fall before getting snatched up again. Even with EV going down, I don't see a world where one of the better reanimation spells printed is below $2 for an extended period of time.

Grabbing Persists (about 80) at the prices I did ended up not being a terrible idea, but it's yet to really pay off. I still think they're underpriced, but my wallet's tapped out on them for the moment.

* Out of Time

&gt;It's Oubliette but a three-mana boardwipe. Commanders can't be put into the command zone as a replacement effect when phasing out, which, aside from it being three mana, is where most of the appeal is. Vanishing is pretty much a non-issue here - 99% of the time, OOT leaves the battlefield because of Naturalize. This does not seem like a sub-$1 card to me.

I still love the card and it being near-bulk is astounding to me. It's still significantly better than many of the crappy MH2 rares at or near its price. I went in for nearly 200 at an average of \~$.38.

* Unmarked Grave

&gt;On one hand, I don't think it has the broad appeal of something like Persist, but on the other, there really aren't as many low-cost grave tutors out there as there are reanimation spells. We have Entomb and Buried Alive competing with it, and that's about it. Nothing else directly comparable with it in Modern either. Keep an eye on it.

I bought a decent handful of these at or near the $1 floor, and they've gone up to about $2.50 and still seem to have a good bit of buying pressure on them. Card's good.

* Dress Down

&gt;Given how many interesting things you can do with it, I think this has to find a home eventually. Make Death's Shadow a 13/13. Blank Spell Queller just before it's death. Effectively counter Snapcasters. Remove Infect and Prowess. Stick a Kroxa for 1UBR. Completely screw over any of the mythic Elemental Incarnations in the set. Basically skip the Amulet Titan or Stoneblade player's turn. Break out of a Death &amp; Taxes lock. Stall a Commander. It's a situational card, but there are a lot of relevant situations. Crucially, it replaces itself - at absolute worst, you cycle it for 1U. That said, I'm waiting for a few days to pick up more of these.

This card is the big buzz in MTGFinance at the time that I write this. I picked up about 80 in total for $.25 each. As of writing, we're in the middle of a buyout on these and they've gone for as much as $7 now, just a bit over what you could buy an Ignoble Hierarch for. Dress Down currently sees some experimentation in Modern Grixis Shadow, is a 3/4-of in Legacy Miracles, and sees a (very) modest amount of EDH play. I think by play metrics, it's an underrated card, but upwards of $7 and beginning to rival Hierarch, Subtlety, Voidwalker, and Yavimaya is clearly a buyout, followed by intense FOMO - It's at the price I'd've expected it to have been after a year or so, not two months out from release. However, just because it's a buyout doesn't mean it won't be or hasn't been successful. Indeed, Card Kingdom already raised their buylist prices to up to $1.75 for normal versions at one point, and are currently sitting at $1.35 for both normal and sketch versions, with plenty of stock they're willing to buy. I'd fully expect them to raise their prices in the coming days, as the demand is evidently real enough to profit off of relatively safely. 

The main two questions regarding the card right now are where the top is, and where it will settle when it comes down. Given how hard it's clowning on the rest of MH2, and the fact that I've never seen a buyout and spike of this order on a previously bulk rare from an in-print, just-released set like this before, I have no good answers to those questions. It's possible that the spike brings more attention to what I believe is an underrated card, and organic demand will increase as it sees more experimentation. It's also possible that this causes copycat buyouts on similar underdog MH2 cards. I certainly don't know for sure.

* Search the Premises, Moderation, Dermotaxi, Piru

&gt;I'm good to pick these up when they become bulk. They seem to be a step above crap like Magus of the Bridge, Calibrated Blast, and Necrogoyf, in that they'll still be dirt cheap when the MH2 hype dies down, but they'll actually have a chance at future gains.

I ended up picking up a fair amount of Piru, Search, and Moderation at their bottoms, of which I'm most optimistic about Piru, given she's an elder dragon and can go in pretty much any Mardu EDH deck with varying degrees of success. Didn't pick up Dermotaxi in numbers and I don't expect I will unless it goes below $.10 somehow. I'm kinda eyeing Master of Death as being copies 5-8 of Squee, and Wonder at bulk prices doesn't seem too bad to me either.

Other things I didn't mention but that caught me off guard were Endurance climbing to \~$35 (I knew it was good, but I wasn't expecting second-best-non-fetch-card-in-the-set good), Ignoble Hierarch being as low as it's gotten (you can pick up sketch versions for about $7 right now), Asmora being pretty low (I've gotten her as low as $.50, and she's the co-star of a fairly successful Modern archetype right now),

One recent example - guy posts about a collection of about 80 cards that's $1,200 TCG Low that included nothing crazy but had a couple force of wills, a handful of khans and mh2 retro frame fetches, and a number of other things in the $30-50 range amongst the group. He was asking $1080 and his TCG Low tracker had everything at NM. I send him a message asking for some pics and 1 FoW is LP and the other is border line HP. I got to assume much of the rest is at least LP.

If we go back to January, you can see some of this historic listing on Amazon of $199 and you can find specific sales of $270 and above.  

Fewer people are buying these boxes today at $80-94 than were buying these boxes at $150+. The market supply of boxes is plentiful and is not planned to run out any time soon. If we take the chasest of the chase rares (Allosaurus Shepherd) we can see the price is no longer dropping leveling out around $70-$75.

The distributor sales price to game stores has been $59. There has been some word that the smaller stores were charged up to $69. At release, small stores received 36-48 boxes and large stores received up to the 500 range. 

This represents a pretty good case study of how low can a box price go. The replacement cost for a box is significantly lower than the market price but there is a very limited number of stores willing to chase the price to the bottom. We can speculate why this is happening but it is an interesting market phenomenon. 

If you consider that WOTC was blowing out ZKR set boxes at $86 when stores were paying $78 which  reduced the margin to $8 if they choose to try to compete, then selling Jumpstart for cost $15 at $74 would be comparatively a much better deal but it's not happening.

Jumpstart and Mystery Booster have been the largest profit centers for LGS's with the initial releases being limited to Game Stores while demand is high. This enabled stores to sell their initial waves and first restocks at significant margins. Some stores were selling for north of $200 a box, netting them at least $140 x however many boxes there were allocated.

The long-term value of this product will be interesting to watch, because it is unclear if the natural base price point for this product is the $59 cost, the $80-94 market stabilization point, or the historic high of $250+.

"Are foils of [Island #337](https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/f/8/f849f726-c6a2-400d-9b90-fe050f8ef5eb.jpg?1562945046) from Invasion a good investment?  I'm curious what people think.  I bought 30 copies for a Commander deck, spending about $300 on *basic lands*. Here's my rationale:

Ever since WOTC started reprinting foil basic lands with iconic art like [Odyssey Plains 333](https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/5/1/51b0dd0f-8ad8-4292-9df6-7b28ab4605e3.jpg?1562909992) (aka ""Thunder Plains"") in [Collector Boosters and Bundles](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/modern-horizons-2-product-overview-2021-05-21), the old foil basic lands from sets like Invasion, Onslaught, and Odyssey don't seem nearly as immune to reprints as they once did.  It may not be long before WOTC reprints other ""iconic"" basic lands like [Lorwyn Island #287](https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/2/4/24ffadeb-cf20-4da9-a140-1fdcc7484c7a.jpg?1562341773) as ""retro"" foils.  So I started thinking:  which set foil basic lands have artwork that is guaranteed to never be used again?  And I finally came up with Island #337 from Invasion, by Terese Nielsen.

While Terese Nielsen illustrated nearly 200 Magic cards, she didn't illustrate many basic lands. In fact, not including the Judge Rewards [Panorama](https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/6/4/644791df-ac34-45c7-90c1-0ebd9e519840.jpg?1562258456) lands and [Guru](https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/7/9/79fe9e5e-3ddc-4b15-81d5-9659cd087649.jpg?1562531010) lands, to my knowledge Terese only illustrated three basic lands: a forest from Unglued, a plains from Tempest, and the island from Invasion.  And of these, only the island is available as a set foil (although the plains did get a foil reprint in the all-foil, Premium Sliver deck).  And it's pretty safe to assume WOTC will never use Terese's artwork again.

I'm sure some people will think I'm crazy for spending $10 each for a pile of basic lands, the most common game piece in all of Magic. And it's true, for $300 I could have bought something more traditional like a lightly played Wheel of Fortune.  But instead I bought foil Island #337 from Invasion, a card I think is both scarce and desirable.  But will it pay off someday? There just aren't that many foil basic lands worth more than a few dollars.",Island #337 from Invasion

"Please read this entire thing before you post because it's likely I will address alot of your concerns.  Also, I'd like to give a bit of context.  I used to be a small whale, but mostly collector who sold off their tens of thousands dollar collection a few years ago to invest in more traditional avenues.  I still have a few of my favorite decks that I update, worth maybe a few thousand dollars, but mostly am subbed here just because I like to keep up every once and a while.  I'll also buy a collectors booster on impulse every once and a while from target and the like just to scratch that itch every once and a while.

I've also been coming to this forum and been in the mtg finance game for a long time.  My first big spec was Birthing Pod where I went very deep and won BIG before it got banned then subsequently lost a large portion of that chasing that high before cooling off and started investing rather than specing to much greater success.  Recently, basically since mtg products came to Amazon, I have been noticing that a growing portion of the posts here are advertisements.  Now I don't think most are malicious.  They are good samaritans looking to get others good deals, but they are advertisements none the less.

Part of this rise is that we are now in a scarcity economy, where you can't just go down to your LGS or online vendor and just buy what you want, so these ""drops"" become a big deal.  I had a similar fight getting a PS5 and every time they would drop.  I'd let my friends and family that were trying to get one in on it.  I get it.  You either get the ""drop"" or the sale, or you pay exorbitant mark ups.  There might also be some LGS's who are posting these through their own employees' accounts, and I'm not accusing any, and I also get it.  Their business could be at at jeopardy, having to fight against the juggernaut that is Amazon.  Better businesses have tried and failed.  Heck there might even be local patrons posting to try and save their LGS because that might be their only venue to play the game.

This last point is personal and also very un-mtgfinace, but there's also the fact that these posts/advertisements add to the already very prevalent FOMO (fear of missing out for those newbies) that is present in mtg.  It's hard enough to get product without members of a single subreddit mobbing every drop or sale that happens and adding what, in my opinion, is an artificial increase demand (though that is good for mtg finance).  It feels very much like the runs on banks back in the Great Depression and can't be good for players, but is very good for WotC and Amazon.

I look at the game from a very different lens from others, being much less active in mtg anymore.  The way I see it, you can ignore these posts/advertisements and I'll probably unsub with no hostility.  I am completely okay with this not being the place for me and have no ill will.  If there are others who feel the same way, they will likely post their support below, but it's likely that many, if not most, redditors come here specifically for this information, given the quality of the posts/comments (hehe).  Another option would be to have these labeled as advertisements.  This would show a bit more transparency into what they actually are, though again, I think they are being made with the best of intentions, but also let others filter them out.  Ideally posts without this tag would be deleted, but that is asking a lot of an already hard working mod crew.  I'd love to hear what you all think.  Regardless of what this subreddit decides, I think this is a conversation is worth having.  I am very busy, so I will likely not reply frequently or quickly, but will make as much of an effort as possible to remain as part of the conversation.",Should we keep allowing people to advertise Amazon and/or LGS sales on here?

"So genuinely curious about this. These are only my thoughts so feel free to tell me where I'm wrong

It seems to me like the value of alpha/beta/old magic cards are in parts driven by a few investors essentially buying and hoarding the cards. There are investors out there holding millions in vintage mtg collections (e.g. Rudy from Alpha Basement).

But you'd assume one day they'd have to start liquidating to you know, you can't pay mortgages or food with magic cards.

"I'm making this post as a heads up for people on what to look out for. I purchased a \~$250 card, and received a counterfeit that was very convincing. It made me realize each valuable card needs an extra level of scrutiny from now on. Here's how I determined it was a fake.

The first thing I always do is look for the red ""L"" on the green dot on the back of the card. Other counterfeits I've seen have, to this point, failed this test in an obvious way. They typically have lots of red dots throughout the space where only the L should be. On this card, there wasn't any red dots. Some real cards have very faint red dots, so not being able to see one doesn't mean a card is a fake, and when I looked at this card, I thought that's what I was seeing at first because it didn't have the obvious scattering of red dots I'd seen on other fakes. 

Fortunately, I have two other versions of this card from the same printing, so I was able to compare them side by side. I noticed the fake had a slightly rougher back. I've felt authentic cards that had slightly different feels to the glossiness, so again, this didn't lead me to conclude with certainty it was a fake.

The final straw was the hologram on the front. On my real cards, the hologram is part of the card. You can't feel an edge to it. On the fake, you could very slightly feel an edge, and if you scratch at that edge, the hologram starts to come off. That's when I knew it was a fake.",Received a very convincing counterfeit from a seller on TCG with over 1000 positive feedback

"Hey folks; last year I snagged a bunch of core 2018-2020 (12 total) boxes for cheap and recently cracked them for fun during quarantine. Was curious, what is your usual minimum card value for you deem ""worth it"" when buy-listing. Obviously there are a bunch of uncommon and common chaff sitting in the .07-.25 area in these sets, but at what point do you deem it ""not worth it"" to send them in?   


My thoughts:

On one hand, I see to selling these uncommon/common chaff as opportunities to get into ""higher"" (relative) value/reserve list/edh staples. They pay direct dividends in two ways:   
\- they are directly relevant to my decks (""fun"" as currency).

\- they are statistically more likely to increase in value (""value"" as currency).

On the other hand, we have stuff like \[\[Stitchers Supplier\]\] and \[\[Pitiless Plunderer\]\] that have crept up dramatically in value over time. While these cards definitely have unique effects that make them great combo pieces, it does make me consider - does the upside (+ 0.07 cents per card credit) make it worth the potential gain, even when they aren't inherently as good? I'm also trying to look at them like penny stocks and not FOMO; the card could remain obscure and useless while even a $1 additional credit could get me into something that ultimately becomes infinitely more useful.

"As we all remember, there was a lot of speculation about the price trends of MH2 Fetchlands before the set came out. I decided that, since it's been almost exactly two months since the pre-release, it was time to do a bit of a check on where things are going with MH2 Fetchlands and to see what lessons if anything we can learn from that.

In order to do this analysis, I went to MTGGoldfish and pulled the price charts for 5 different versions of each fetchland: (1) Basic, (2) Extended Art, (3) Retro Frame, (4) Retro Frame Foil, and (5) Retro Frame Foil-Etched. I excluded the pack foil and the extended art foil to keep things somewhat simple. I then recorded  the price of each for every Monday and Friday from 6/11/21 to 8/9/21, which is almost exactly two months.

[Here is the average price chart for all 5 MH2 fetches combined](https://imgur.com/VBWP4MG). What you can see from this graph is a few things:

* **Prices on the standard, non-variant versions of fetches have plateaued in the last few weeks.** Since mid-July, the average fetch price has fluctuated in a price range between $30.78 and $31.74. Similarly, prices on the variants are also stabilizing, with little price movement at all on MH2 fetches over the past few weeks. Whether prices will begin rising again remains to be seen, as there is still a huge amount of unsold supply out there.

* We all know not to buy singles during the presale period or on release weekend, but the data shows something interesting; **for MH 2 fetches this was only true for variants.** On 6/18 when MH2 released, the average price for a basic version of an MH2 fetch was $32.04. Today it's $31.68. The data shows that the **high prices for pre-releases were linked only to fetch variants;** average price of a retro-frame foil MH2 fetch was $115.04 on release weekend, and today it's $76.48.

* At some point in early July, the market decided that non-foil retro-framed fetches were more desirable than other variants. Since that point, non-foil retro-frame fetches have been more valuable than retro-frame foil-etched fetches.

In addition to looking at the average prices for fetches, I also wanted to calculate how well the various different versions of the fetchlands are performing over the base version, so [I mapped out what the percent above the base value each version is selling for](https://imgur.com/rRaXceU). Over the last month:

* Retro foils are selling roughly 140-150% above base
* Retro nonfoils are selling roughly 85-95% above base
* Retro foil-etched are selling roughly 45-50% above base
* Extended art nonfoils are selling roughly 10-12% above base.

This confirms a lot of what people were expecting; the chase versions are the retro-frame foils, and the foil-etched are significantly less desirable than the base retro fetches. 

Extended art cards, which held more of a value in prior sets, are now a distant fourth when it comes to value among MH2 fetches, only selling for a few dollars more than the base versions. The market clearly prefers the retro frame for these.

"Hello to MTGFinance people everywhere!

Some of you may not like what I have to say, but please read this through to the end before flaming me. With that out of the way, let's get started.

I'm of the opinion that the Reserved List has to go. However there are people among you who say they will sue Wizards if that were to happen. These people seal playing pieces in hard cases so they can no longer be played with. Those playing pieces that are not sealed away are either heavily damaged or hoarded in these people's collections. Yet these same people want people to play the very formats that require these playing pieces! I'm talking about Vintage, and to a lesser extent, Legacy. The main playing pieces that are hoarded are those cards on the Reserved List, with the biggest offenders being the Power 9, dual lands, and other powerful cards from Vintage and Legacy alike. Pretty hypocritical, isn't it?

I do realize that proxies are a viable way to play these formats. But let's be honest. Who would want to use proxies if the actual cards were more affordable? Proxies aren't legal in sanctioned tournaments, which are the primary way Magic is played nowadays. If these people truly wanted people to play Vintage and Legacy, they would see their hypocrisy and take steps to make these formats accessible to everyone, instead of a tiny elite.

People would LOVE to play Vintage, but the price of the Power 9 and other key cards keeps them out.  Anyone who has played Vintage or Legacy loves these formats! Why let others miss out?

When Edwin the Magic Engineer did a video ""proving"" that the Reserved List going away would cause the cards to tank in value, he used Imperial Recruiter as an example. The problem is that Imperial Recruiter is only played in one deck, Legacy Aluren. If the Power 9, dual lands, and other widely played cards were reprinted. they would go down some, but not quite as much. Sure, Imperial Recruiter halved in price, but that doesn't mean that the power 9 would too. In fact, there is no fair comparison to the Reserved list cards being reprinted.

I wish these collectors would see sense and sell out. Most never actually play with these cards,. The Reserved List is outdated, a relic from a bygone time. The game has moved on, and we should too. Let's make Vintage and Legacy accessible to everyone again!

&amp;#x200B;

Flesh and Blood lacks a player base and as such the longterm value of the cards is pretty close to $0, by longterm we are probably talking about 5-10 years. 

If we take the sales of Flesh &amp; Blood sales on eBay and from Rudy you can see start to see a pattern emerge. As an FYI, Flesh &amp; Blood is primarily sold to the US market. The offshore holding company does not disclose Ex-US sales but all accounts point to them being about 10% or less of overall volume.

Rudy has sold about 50,000 kits. Some are $300, some $500, and others are $1,500+ (there might have even been a cheaper one in there). Let's use an average of $500 for his kits 50,000 kits.

50,000 x $500 = $25,000,000. This is a rough estimate but it's probably pretty close to what Rudy has grossed from his Patrons on Flesh &amp; Blood.

The Flesh &amp; Blood flipping from one ""investor"" to another ""investor"" at a higher price to another ""investor"" at a higher price takes place on eBay primarily. Ebay's sales for Flesh &amp; Blood in 2021 are roughly 3,878 sold listings in the $100- $500 range, 527 sold listings for 500 - 1000, and 426 listings sold for over $1,000. Ebay has purged most of their 2020 data so we have to go by the numbers we see listed here even given the steep declines in 2021.

Quick math

Averaging $250 for 3,878 = $969,500

Average 750 for 527 = $395,250

Average about $2,000 for 426 listing = $852,000

&amp;#x200B;

New boxes coming to market sell for about $40 - $50, that's a 90% decline. This decline is due to the number of new ""investors"" looking to flip products has dried up. This has caused a severe imbalance of supply of new boxes looking to be sold to investors with few new ""investors"" willing to participate in this scheme.

There are also some sales from TCG, Channel Fireball, and other local game stores.

Let's put this figure at $1 million TCG, $250k CFB and $1 million game store network (almost all WPN stores received premium products including 1st editions from Flesh &amp; Blood in 2021). 

2020 is harder to estimates as prices were significantly more elevated  so let's dive into the best we can.

Assume sales of $2 million from TCG, $2M from CFB, another $4 from the game store network then we come to eBay. Flesh &amp; Blood ranked as some of the most popular selling during certain months in 2020. Hot months on eBay saw eBay coming in hot with more than $5 million in flips of the above categories and slower months came in at $3-$4m. eBay has taken down this data so let us estimate this to be in $53 million in eBay 2020 sales. 

This takes us to 2020 sales of $53m + 2m +2m +$4m = $61m

2021 sales 965k + 395k + 852k + 1m + 1m + 250k = $4.4462

Rudy Sales - $25 million

Estimated Overseas outside of Rudy and eBay sales - $8 million

This Flesh &amp; Blood investment scheme may be close to breaching $100 million.

This fraud scheme is primarily sold to the US market through the offshore parent holding company and filtered through Rudy at Alphainvestments. You should pursue Rudy for all losses. 

We should take a minute and appreciate the magnitude of this fake currency fraud scheme. The mid to long term value of these cards is basically $0.

"Just wanted to say a few things:

I got a bunch of TSR a while back, and then I had a revelation.

“Why would I buy reprints?”

There’s a few Nolan Ryan rookie card reprints out there. 

Guess how much they’re *not* worth? 

I fully believe WOTC/Amazon/Monopoly Man will do a reprint set every year now around the same time. All of which will follow the pattern of compiling the better cards of one block, for example the Kamigawa sets.

I laugh at people buying Pokémon Evolutions as well, but I digress.

"Hello all,
I just wanted to pass on a situation I’m in that might give a heads up to those outside the USA that might but want sell cards to Card Kingdom in the foreseeable future.

I sold a stack of modern/legacy/commander staples to Card Kingdom on July 20th. It came out to a good chunk of money, and their FAQ stated that we should allow up to 10 business days for orders to be received.

As it is past the 10 days, including a holiday here in Canada, I emailed their support to ask how much time should pass before I worry that the cheque is lost. The email I got said the following;

‘I apologize for the delay! With all packages heading into Canada right now, we have to allow 45 days for delivery. If you still don't have the check by September 3rd, we can get to work on an alternate resolution. Let me know if I can answer any other questions in the meantime’

So, without any warning on their site, leaving customers in limbo outside of the US, card kingdom seems to not give a crap by at least giving a warning at a super unreasonable delay. I wasn’t given a choice to express ship the cheque, or I would have. They now have thousands of dollars worth of cards to sell and who knows if they have even truly even sent the cheque.

So, the heavily played card is 50% of the price of a near-mint one.  


Suppose the price of a near mint Black Lotus goes up to $100k in 10 years. Is it reasonable to expect that the heavily played one would continue to be worth half that of the near-mint one and be worth $50k?",Does the value of a lower condition card stay proportional to a better condition one?

I often buy from my LGS but due to being on-call for Healthcare IT, it's best I don't leave the house in the off chance I get called in. So I ordered on Amazon and this was a mistake. One box has been dropped and ran over by one of their carts (you could see into the packs just by spreading the cardboard) and the other was completely opened, all packs gone through and replaced with commons. Thankfully I never return things to Amazon so I got to keep both without a return and got a refund but if you see this, DON'T RETURN THE ITEM AS YOU FOUND IT. Amazon asked if I wanted to return the item and I told them that is why I got it in the first place, someone returned it and it got purchased by me and pickers (Amazon employees pulling product) don't look for these things. I would have return it but I would have made it very obvious it could not be resold by tearing it up or completely removing the cards from the packs. Amazon cannot prove you have done this and will make it less likely they can just throw it back on the shelf. No, this is not a perfect fix but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.

Quantity:
My LGS has gotten at least 100 boxes and it's not even a really big store either. The amount my LGS got is higher than I would've expected and I'm assuming that larger stores are getting even more. This amount is also obviously a fuck load higher than the original convention boosters. 

Value:
Primarily, rhystic study was removed from the list. Some other cards like nature's lore and mother of runes were also removed. The cards that will now appear twice as often as replacement contain a couple of hits like sakashima and priest of titania. Overall it seems like theres a slight drop in value.

Price:
My LGS is currently pre selling for about $150USD.

"While I personally believe the disdain for this set is a little overdone, it's impossible to ignore that the power level is weak, the set itself overhyped, and seemingly a majority people are ultimately unimpressed.

You can currently get Zendikar Rising and Kaldheim for as low as $89 a draft box, and mid-low $90's for set. Do we expect AFR to mimic this, go lower, find a higher foothold? anyone long term will probably be ok (if they wait long enough and try not to think about what the money could have done is $SPY) but I'm curious where people see this set landing until supply one day begins to dry up.

And then the jowls on his face started vibrating and I got scared because the veins in his face started bulging and he looked like he had some experience with killing. So I grabbed the nearest chair and smacked him across the face with it. I didn't realize that the chair was being used to hold a carton of hot sauce, so when I smacked him, the carton exploded and there was sauce everywhere. Might've been some blood everywhere too, since it hit pretty hard.

"The primary value of MTG cards comes from the player base. As prices of usable cards drop, players come in to buy them at discounted rates which them props them back up, look at all the dual lands dumping into the market and being absorbed broadly one at a time to various players. This is what drives the value of the collectible MTG market. As ""whales"" unload positions, there is a market to sell to of players that want the cards. That is the fundamental underpinning of why MTG Finance works. Cards have significant play value have a fairly high floor for their prices. 

Look at the charts, you see downward trajectory where investors dump positions into the market and then prices increase as players buy up the cards.

The supposed card games that lie about having a player base, let's use Flesh &amp; Blood as an example, do not have a floor to support prices. Instead, the mechanism of price support is based on ""investors"" watching various Flesh &amp; Blood product prices drop and trying to buy low to reflip to another ""investor"" who then reflips to another ""investor"". This flipping back and forth at a higher price worked in 2020 and it's hard for the ""investors"" to get out of the mindset of reflipping a product with no price floor.

Rudy ran a video yesterday teasing a Black Lotus so he could try to sell Flesh and Blood cards. Magic the Gathering was always the lure to bring people into this Flesh &amp; Blood fiasco.  

I think it's important for us to remember, the biggest losers in the Flesh &amp; Blood fake currency fiasco are going to be MTG players who watched Rudy's videos, found him entertaining, and then bought into his scheme. It is going to hurt the community as a whole and a lot of people are going to lose more money than they can afford. 

Flesh &amp; Blood as one that has a foreign shell company pumping money into Rudy and now Tolarian to try to keep the fake currency scheme going. Rudy this week has started the campaign of ""I won't stop you from flipping this product for product"". This is a warning sign of a significant risk of prices dropping quickly. There are many ""investors"" still holding Flesh &amp; Blood hoping that somehow, someway, the game will find a player base.

I highly encourage anyone who has lost money on Flesh &amp; Blood products to pursue Rudy for your full losses. The shell company that owns Flesh &amp; Blood has made fraudulent claims dating back to before any cards were made including claiming there was a secondary market for cards that did not exist at that time. They still continue to carry on the legacy of this claim on their website ""A key consideration for us with Flesh and Blood has been to ensure that there is a strong secondary market for the cards""

I was looking at the price history of some cards over on MTGGoldfish's price history tracker and noticed that many of the cards I looked at had a remarkable price spike in the last three years. I only recently got back into the game and was wondering what might have happened to cause this? Is it mainly due to the game becoming SO much more popular very recently, or something else?

For context I was looking at the original Eldrazi titans from Rise of the Eldrazi. \[\[Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre\]\] was about $10 back then and stayed relatively low until after Throne of Eldraine came out where he started to rise in price and recently capped at over $100.

The total print runs of these types of rares would be around 20,000 (equivalent to ARN/ATQ/LEG rares)

The reason is none of the cards nowadays will ever see their value rise really high, even in 15-20 years.

How do you feel about people buying up for example Rainbow vale or Halls of mist, I have a nice amount of that. What Ive been doing now though is buying up uncommon foils of some iconic cards by some of the artists out there, cards look absolutely beatufiul. i thought the same with memory jar.    


Its crazy how much foil cards cost, some of the uncommons cost more than the rares, so that's my next question. ive seen some really rare uncommon foils, like from 2004 specifically, ill just leave it at that, where the non foil costs 25 cents at most, and then rare is like $150 with only 1 auction and its sold out everywhere. Should I buy at $50 for example? This is what I did. I don't see anything for sale since then.

"I was on break when most of them were released but my understanding is that each of the Modern Masters sets was received positively by the players; the first one especially is like a treasure trove of every top tier card from the format at that time with reprints of almost every good Mirrodin and Kamigawa block cards.  The third one had enemy fetchlands, their first reprinting ever after nearly 10 years without one, and we all know that's enough to make players happy.

I believe I've heard that **Eternal Masters** was not well received but I don't understand why.  It was the first non-judge reprinting of Force of Will and Mana Crypt, both of which had not been printed in 20 years.  Same thing for the Mirage tutors, which last appeared in 6th Edition, and Sylvan Library, last seen in 5th Edition, Wasteland (Tempest) and Ashnod's Altar (Chronicles).  It was also the first time Sensei's Divining Top and Chrome Mox got reprints.  Finally, some early Commander-set and Conspiracy cards that had gotten rather expensive were repinted--looking at you Dack Fayden, Toxic Deluge, Baleful Strix (now finally cheap b/c of all the reprints).

**Iconic Masters** I understand.  There's just Mana Drain, which while a huge reprint, is followed by  Aether Vial, Necropotence (printed just a year earlier in Eternal so the value was low then), Cryptic Command, Horizon Canopy (a legit expensive card then), and a slew of things that are expensive now but weren't then, like Auriok Champion, Jin-Gitaxas, Bloodghast, etc.   *Or was this set better received than I think it was?*

**Masters 25** I was back for and I remember it getting a very chilly reception, to the point where WotC said ""No more masters sets then!""  There's very little in it that's exciting except for Imperial Recruiter, Jace (banned in Modern at the time of release), Chalice of the Void, and Ensnaring Bridge.

**Ultimate Masters** was a slam dunk and not only introduced us to extended art cards but had an impressive stack of Modern, Legacy, and Commander playable reprints.  Karn Liberated, Cavern of Souls, Noble Hierarch, and Engineered Explosives were each $80 cards at the time of release and UMA brought the first two down to $40 (I know b/c I was able to buy into Modern Humans because of this set) and the second down to $10.  While the prices have risen back to where they were, Liliana of the Veil (then $100), Mana Vault ($75-80? $100?), Snapcaster Mage ($75), Demonic Tutor ($50), Bitterblossom ($50), Ancient Tomb ($30) all had huge dents taken out of their price points.  I remember snagging Tombs from Tempest for $18 after the set came out! 

**Double Masters** was another home run.  This post is getting long and this set is fresh in our memory but it was taken quite well.

I'm not forcing anyone I just see it as an experiment how much this card can move in 1-3 years. Mtg lion moved Narwhal and look how many started talking about him in different articles.

Whenever an artifact is put into an opponent's graveyard from the battlefield, you may draw a card.

Supply: This card is an uncommon from 11 years ago with a single printing. 

Playability: With the increase in artifact tokens this card can be a power house. In EDH (I doubt it’s playable in other formats), staples like smothering tithe and dockside create a ton of artifact tokens. Also, with the influx of food and clue of recent, this card is even better. The banning of Hullbreacher also makes this card more playable. Additionally, it was mentioned on EDHRECast 173 (at 25:00). They speak about an opponent being careful about popping treasures from dockside as it draws you a card per each. Additionally casual play where an opponent sacs a commander’s sphere draws you a card as well. 

[EDHRECast 173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMCBKRe22T8)

Downside: It’s double green. At least it’s not double white (or red).

In: bought 40 for $.185 ea (under $8)
Out: don’t care it was $8.

Additional notes: Listed median for foils is already approaching $10 while market is just under $2.",Spec: Viridian Revel

"Does \[\[Search for Glory\]\] have as much room for growth as I think? Currently at Card Kingdom you can get base version for $0.39 and the extended for $0.69. Here are some things it has going for it:

1. Unique effect- It's a 3 CMC tutor in white. Good white cards are always popular in EDH and this certainly fits that.
2. Slightly harder to mass reprint- It references snow so I don't believe it would just be thrown into any non-snow based set or product. May be relegated to The List reprints until we see snow again.
3. Increasingly relevant text- Sagas and Legendary cards are two card types that have been growing each set the past few years. Just look at the number of legendary creatures by set in 2019 vs now. With the rumored upcoming returns to Kamigawa and Dominaria, two planes that heavily leaned in to the legendary theme, we are almost guaranteed to see this trend grow.

To be clear, I don't know anything about 60-card formats and if a 3 CMC tutor can work, but I do know EDH.

"Longtime mtg player &amp; flipper here, but relatively new to the reserved list &amp; economics of $X,xxx valued cards.

I'm curious if anyone else has had anything graded through them, and if so, what are your thoughts, pros and cons on their service?

From what I've seen so far, this is my current thinking:

PROS
- Reasonable pricing for lower priority grading
- Strong track record/reputation for other collectibles

CONS
- Relatively new to grading mtg cards
- Lack of reputation in the mtg world

"Recently I have been researching collection tracking tools, however from my preliminary findings it seems most have big flaws, whether that be bad pricing data or an incomplete card database. I don’t mind paying for a service that has what I need. Here are a few of my biggest priorities for a tracking service:

* An easy to read, big graph. Ideally updates every day, but if it updates every time I log in that is acceptable. 
* Sort by price change over a longer period of time. Most seem to have day/week gains, but I 1) don’t want to have to check every day and 2) want to be able to see the slow-changing cards easier. Month/year/custom timeframe would be ideal. 
* A way to tag/group cards. This allows you to easily see how cards of a certain category are doing, i.e. modern staples, EDH specs, etc.
* Track amount spent, ideally also having a way to enter generic amounts of money spent such as event entry fees so I know how much I am spending on Magic in general.

In addition to these things, I would hope any service would also have

* Accurate pricing (I am fine with tcgmid if that's the only thing offered)
* Complete card database
* Good UI (something as simple as mtggoldfish set pages w/ a graph and table would be just fine)

"Legitimate question by somebody who has never actually  had the balls to park any sort of money into a booster box of any kind for speculative purposes.
 
MH2 seems like an insane set. It has fetches (which would seemingly gain in price after the set is out of print), as well as a lot of extremely powerful cards for multiple formats (though mostly Modern). Supposedly, the expected value has had trouble staying below the draft booster box price for a lot more than your average print to demand set. 

These, as well as the price trajectory of MH1 are all signs pointing toward a draft booster box being a solid investment. So much so that it seems suspicious to me. You pay between 170€ and 190€ for a box, which already seems to be something of a floor.

What are the reasons you should not buy a few (or a few dozen if you have the capital) boxes of MH2 seeing as it can seemingly only go up from here? Is it that too many people thinking the same way and trying to panic sell later would cause the price to stagnate?
Or is it perhaps that investing in some other safe investment vehicle would yield higher returns?

"Apologies in advance for formatting on mobile. Another fraudulent eBay listing that ends in a few hours. I was actually going to bid on this lot until he added the last 3 photos today showing a mox sapphire, ancestral recall, etc… as a if anyone would sell these as part of a “bulk lot”.

Also, a quick google reverse image search shows those photos were pulled from various mtg blogs.

I reported the listing but unlikely ebay does anything before someone gets trapped in a purchase.

What is the seller’s scam strategy here? Unless they have proxies of every card are they just hoping buyers don’t notice that they don’t receive Power 9? Money back guarantee should protect the buyer I’d assume.

"AFR just launched with the largest reduction in supply available at release in recent memory and is struggling to sell into a thriving MTG market. MTG Finance isn’t everything but players are speaking with their wallets and not buying this product. 

This gives us the first real chance to see how much damage a dud set can do to the MTG market. All of the criticism of TBD and Kaldheim Being wreaked failed sets seems to be misplaced in the wake of the impact of the AFR flop. We haven’t had a genuinely bad set in so long that we don’t have good data on the long term trajectory of one. In the modern era where box hoarding is prevalent, it will be interesting to see where this one goes.

Long term, sets that do not sell have had lower supply as WOTC did not print as many boxes because they could not sell them (this lesson was learned from Fallen Empires and Homelands). The lower print runs have in turn created a form of price support for the sets.

I realize there are fanatics that like AFR, just as there are people who love the playability of un-sets or a good hard kick in the junk. You do you, if that’s your thing then I hope you enjoy it discretely on your own terms.

 Outside of those distinct groups, there appears to be a widespread undertone of disappointment among the player base leading to fewer sales, tournaments, pre-releases, events, and excitement.”.",Long-term trajectory of Adventures in the Forgotten Realms

"Aside from \[\[Dockside Extortionist\]\] and \[\[Ohran Frostfang\]\], none of the cards in this set are currently values at over $10, which seems absurd to me. Here are a few standout cards from these decks that are primed to make a move. 

&amp;#x200B;

\[\[Scroll of Fate\]\] is a card that was overhyped during spoilers, but dropped to around 75c quickly after. It still sees fringe legacy play in Stiflenaught decks, whch is a deck that is starting to see more play as the deck highly synergizes with \[\[Dress Down\]\] from MH2. This card also sees a large amount of play in Yorion, Emiel, and Kadena EDH decks, and is one of your best enablers in the Blink strategies.

&amp;#x200B;

\[\[Anje Falkenrath\]\] is another super popular commander, and is one of the best CEDH commanders if players do not want to be playing blue. Its unique effect and overall low availability kind of amaze me as to why she is only $1 right now. This is the card I have been picking up the most.

&amp;#x200B;

\[\[K'rrik, Son of Yawgmoth\]\] is the other Non-blue commander who works great in CEDH, and also leads to a lot of splashy 'big spell/storm' gameplay, which appeals to more casual players. He has never really dipped below $5, despite being the #22 most played commander on EDHREC, right between Breya and Kaalia. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last card I want to mention singularly is \[\[Elsha of the Infinite\]\]. She is the #26th most played commander, although she is currently sitting at bulk rare price at around 50c. I do not expect her to move before a reprint of her hits within the next few years (CL2), but if she's not reprinted there, you will be glad you picked up a few copies at 40c each.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, all of these cards only have 1 printing each.

&amp;#x200B;

Theres a lot of other cards that have a lot of EDH and CEDH applications and combo potential, such as \[\[Song of the Worldsoul\]\], \[\[Strionic Resonator\]\], \[\[Bone Miser\]\], and \[\[Curse of Fool's Wisdom\]\], but I have work in about 15 minutes.

"Since WotC started to sell directly through Amazon in Germany I notices that the English language products are more expensive then the German ones.

Example:
Strixhaven Draft Display:
German 110,00 Euro
English 119,36 Euro




As a lot of German Magic players buy English cards this has never been the case in LGS or with other larger resellers. My LGS confirmed to me that they still get both products for the same price from their distributors. They usually sell 50/50 German / English boosters.

My 2 cent:
Whoever set up the MtG Store page in Germany for Amazon did not look into the market at all. The English products which are really popular are more expensive compared to LGS prices and the German ones are getting really good discounts which makes me believe the storage is full of German product at Amazon because they treated it like any other board game and mostly have German product available.

The current discounts seem to indicate this:
German Strixhaven 84,20€ (full price 110,00 €)
English Strixhaven 108,19 € (full price 119,36 €)

"Here is the article, I'm sure many have read it already: [https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/a-case-for-more-standard-rotations](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/a-case-for-more-standard-rotations)

To be honest, I'm actually kind of shocked. The central premise of the article is that the solution to format-damaging failures in card design is not to address card design, but instead to increase rotation to increase costs to the average player and generate more revenue for the company that **failed at balanced card design in the first place.**

One argument is that players wouldn't mind their decks becoming 'illegal' due to faster rotation because the **broken decks they don't like playing against would also become illegal.** What?

Further, the author argues that players today wouldn't mind the increased cost caused by faster rotation because six years ago Standard was really expensive... so it's not that bad. But at the same time, the author notes that the 2015-2016 period of Standard **was one of the ""all-time most expensive.""** So his argument that players won't mind increasing costs is founded upon comparing it to the **most expensive Standard format ever?**

This also presumes that Standard wouldn't be made **more expensive than it is today for additional reasons** such as increased pack prices, changes to supplemental products like Set and Collector boxes, or some brand new mechanism that Wizards has waiting in the wings. After all, Wizards created the Mythic slot years ago to increase sales and **misled players about never putting must-play tournament cards in the slot.**

It is so weird to hear an argument that the lack of economic value presented by Arena is a significant PLUS. **""Cards on Arena cost exactly what Wizards says they should cost.""** I'm not a hyper-capitalist or anything, but I have a hard time accepting the argument that Arena cards having no resale or trade value (thus, being a sunk cost) is for my own good.

I seriously wonder to what extent this is Wizards putting out a feeler into the community by leveraging someone who doesn't formally represent the company.","Issues with article: ""The Case For More Standard Rotations"""

"I originally wrote and shared a version of this article about six months ago across the Magic Reddit space. At that time it received a lot of criticism and skepticism. I am re-sharing it because it seems particularly relevant given the [recent news about new-to-Magic cards that are exclusive to the digital Jumpstart Horizons release](https://i.imgur.com/jzqX10N.png).

The purpose of this article is to share some thoughts about the future of Magic including digital Magic. I would love to hear thoughts on these ideas, particularly related to how the growth of digital Magic may impact and influence the future value of Magic cards on the secondary market.

**Thesis Statement**: Wizards of the Coast wants as many people to play Magic the Gathering as possible. They want the game to grow, thrive and for the player base to expand. Investing more time, money and resources into digital Magic (i.e. Magic Arena) is going to be key to fundamentally increase the number of people that play Magic.

**Important Note**: Before I proceed with this idea, it's important to understand expanding digital Magic doesn't have to cause negative impact or change paper Magic. WotC spending more time, resources and money on digital Magic doesn't mean they have to create or print less paper Magic cards or sets. More players joining the game and playing the game through digital Magic isn't a zero sum action that has to hurt paper Magic.

**Tons of people have played Magic but the physical paper and table top aspects of the game limit the number of potential new players.**

WotC has said [the number of Magic players since 1993 is 40 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2020/07/29/after-nearly-30-years-game-magic-gathering-is-bigger-than-ever-best-players-may-also-be-teaching-us-about-heroism/?arc404=true). This is referring to people that have played Magic as of 1993, this includes players that are not active and this includes players that have only played a few games. This number includes digital Magic too (but it's worth mentioning that MTGA has only available on Android or iOS for a short period of time). That's a lot of people but WotC wants that number to be much larger.

By comparison, Hearthstone has had over 100 million players in less than 6 years. Hearthstone has had more players NOT because it's a ""better"" or ""more creative"" game. The primary reason there are more than twice as many people that have played Hearthstone than people that have played Magic is because the barrier of entry is much lower for Hearthstone.

**There several benefits to a digital card games like Hearthstone or MTG Arena compared to table top paper Magic from the consumer/player perspective**.

* You can play digital card games like Magic Arena and Hearthstone without having to spend any money.
* You can play digital card games like Magic Arena and Hearthstone without having to go to an LGS or a big box retailer to acquire the game.
* You can play digital card games like Magic Arena and Hearthstone without having to find, know and search out people in real life to be an activity partner in order to play.
* If you have a PC computer or an Android or iOS device (i.e. virtually everyone) you can play the game.
* With mobile devices, you can play digital Magic anywhere and anytime (i.e. outside in the wind while it's snowing, on the subway, on an airplane).

**This means the barrier to entry into the game is MUCH lower. Not just from a financial perspective but also from a quality of life and logistical ease perspective**. The incredibly low barrier to entry is the reason why [in less than 1 year, Magic Arena had over 1 billion games played](https://screenrant.com/magic-arena-one-billion-games/#:~:text=Magic%20Arena%20announced%20today%20through,way%20of%20saying%20thank%20you) (keep in mind that is WITHOUT iOS or Android apps). That's freaking insane.

**Digital Magic has plenty of other advantages**:

* Digital card games are cheaper to produce and better for the environment because there is no packaging, cardboard, printing costs or shopping costs and logistics.
* Digital card games makes errata and banning cards much less consequential and cumbersome for consumers.
* Digital card games like Magic Arena don't have a secondary market. This is a good thing for consumers that are players rather than collectors (i.e. no $50 cards, no card scarcity issues, no spectators manipulating the secondary market with market manipulation)
* Digital card games eliminate certain restrictions that paper Magic creates. For example, WotC could offer a single booster pack with 30 cards or they could create products that might be appealing to a small and niche segment of the player base that wouldn't be worth the physical resources to print in paper Magic (i.e. Pauper and Peasant booster packs for Kaldheim to draft with).
* From the business and corporate perspective, digital Magic cuts out the middle players which is good for business. (i.e. If Taylor spends $100 on Magic Arena and Jamie spends $100 on a booster box at an LGS, WotC makes more of a profit from Taylor's purchase than Jamie's.)
* For competitive play, streaming and watching tournaments is much easier to follow, especially for less adept players.
* For competitive play, shuffling doesn't extend the game time. Additionally, cheating is impossible.

**I believe WotC will eventually create new cards exclusive to digital and even new sets where the majority of the cards are new cards that are exclusive to digital play**. I think this will happen relatively soon, I'm thinking within a few years.

Once again, it's important to keep in mind that this doesn't have to cause a negative impact or change paper Magic. WotC spending more time, resources and money on digital Magic doesn't mean they have to create or print less paper Magic cards or sets. WotC could create as many new paper cards and products as they do today but still also create mechanically unique exclusive digital cards.

Here are some of the reasons I believe this will happen:

**WotC already creates and releases digital and online exclusive cards**.

To the skeptics that believe ""Wizards of the Coast will never release Magic cards exclusive to digital because there's no reason for them not to release paper versions,"" it's worth noting they already do this.

Sometimes this is just art (which they still have to pay for) but sometimes this is new cards. I'm talking about cards like \[\[Soulhunter Rakshasa\]\], \[\[Cruel Cut\]\], \[\[Inspiring Commander\]\] and \[\[Ogre Painbringer\]\]. Or exclusive art on cards like [Cascading Cataracts](https://scryfall.com/card/akr/285/cascading-cataracts), [Breeding Pool](https://scryfall.com/card/prm/72311/breeding-pool) or [Walking Ballista](https://scryfall.com/card/prm/69991/walking-ballista). I believe the former examples are a precursor to exclusive digital cards that are more interesting and appealing.

It is also worth noting that WotC has already been making fundamental design changes in recent years that are beneficial to digital play and offer a drawback to table top play. This includes the removal of positive may ability triggers, more complicated mechanics and cards that have memory issues, (i.e. \[\[Crystalline Giant\]\], \[\[Yidaro, Wandering Monster\]\], Mutate, MFDCs, keyword counters, fewer cards that allow you to ""target player"" instead of ""target opponent"" or that only apply to you). These newer mechanics and changes indicate WotC is beginning to design cards with Magic Arena in mind.

**Mechanically unique cards exclusive to digital Magic have the potential to incentivize paper Magic players that haven't tried playing Magic Arena yet.**

Considering the following example:

&gt;Suppose WotC brings the Commander format or a spiritual successor to Commander on Magic Arena. This new Magic Arena format (""Commander 2""), wouldn't have the full card pool available because WotC isn't going to spend the time and effort to program tens of thousands of old cards that are legal in the format including tons of very niche cards that see little (but do see some) play.

If Commander 2 on Magic Arena is just seen as being a strictly worse Commander, or ""Commander Lite"", with fewer cards and fewer commanders, this wouldn't be very appealing to enfranchised established paper players.

However if WotC created a new Oloro, a new Atraxa and a new Meren card that were intriguing designs exclusively for Commander 2, that could help distinguish the new format and entice players to consider playing both.

I can also imagine WotC introducing cards as digital exclusives for a set period of time but eventually releasing them in paper. They already do this with Standard legal set releases by having them release a week or two early on Magic Arena, but I can imagine a scenario where that exclusivity time window is much longer (i.e. a set is released on Magic Arena three to six months before it's paper Magic counterpart)

**There is a TON of Magic design space that literally can only be done online (or cause logistical problems in paper Magic) that still are very appealing to players.** Here are a few examples:

* Triple faced cards
* Reserved List card reprints
* Cards that let you restart the turn
* Temporal effects that ""go back three turns""
* Tutor effects for specific cards that don't force the player to reveal (i.e. ""Search your library for an enchantment card."" (but you don't have to reveal it)
* Effects that make a random selection among a large group or list (i.e. ""create a 2/2 changeling token with a randomly selected evergreen ability and a random color combination"")
* Effects that normally would create memory issues (i.e. ""if this is the 10th spell you cast this game, draw three cards"")

**There are other benefits or advantages that mechanically unique exclusive digital Magic cards have:**

* Cards being leaked and previewed illegally and unintentionally becomes much more difficult to accomplish because paper packaging and cards don't have to be printed several months in advance of the release date.
* A new set could be released and drafted by thousands on launch day without any of the cards being revealed or known ahead of time by the players.
* ""You Make The Card"" could return and be completed with players seeing and playing with the card in a much shorter time span (I imagine in a scenario like this, this could be an early release digital exclusive that comes to paper several months later).
* Designers and developers at WotC can respond to community feedback when designing new cards much faster (i.e. A new mechanic is introduced and wildly over performs expectations and is incredibly popular, new cards that that mechanic could be introduced in a matter of weeks or months rather than multiple years)

**Final Thoughts**

Paper Magic is always going to be around. There are always going to be players that enjoy playing table top Magic and collecting physical paper Magic cards whether that is in the comfort of their own homes or at LGS's. Many of those consumers are going to remain exclusive paper Magic consumers even as digital Magic grows but Magic Arena and digital Magic is going to explode. The low barrier to entry that digital Magic offers compared to paper Magic is a huge deal.

I'm confident the day will come when there are more people playing Magic digitally than in paper and that day is coming sooner rather than later. I think this will probably happen in the next 3 years or so, not too long after Android and iOS versions of Magic Arena are out of the beta.

I also believe it is possible that in the long term (perhaps 10 to 15 years from now), the majority of new cards introduced into the game will be digital exclusives and while there will still be new cards released in traditional Magic, most paper Magic products and releases will be branded and marketed as nostalgia experiences and collectibles (i.e. Time Spiral Remastered, Secret Lair Drop Series).

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on some of my ideas along with hearing about your perspective on the future of digital Magic in general! :\^)**","Exploring the future of digital Magic, the future of digital exclusive Cards and its impact on the secondary table top market"

1) Works well with the main mechanics of werewolves  (type werewolf, flipping, fighting ect) 

2) within red/green color identity 

3) hard to reprint (reserved list, expensive, otherwise unlikely to show up in a reprint in the new set or commander deck)

To sum up this train of thought, will “box topper” fetches be closer in value to the currently most valuable old border foils in the long run?

It took months to complete, but I went through the process of sorting the collection and selling it for as much as I could. (Well, selling most of it.) I thought this subreddit might appreciate hearing about what it takes in terms of time, money, and labor to sell $3,000 in cards—and what it actually means when someone says their collection is worth $3,000.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Find**

He first handed me the cards in December 2020. What he had was a small shopping bag *FULL* of cards. A lot of Magic, even more Pokémon, and a few random sports and playing cards, along with a binder of Garbage Pail Kids. Most of the bagged cards were loose and unprotected, but about 100 were in top loaders—without inner sleeves and often jammed two per top loader.

As far as MTG went, I knew what to look for and how to sort the collection. He had a Beta Will-o’-the-Wisp, a few Reserved List cards, and lots of commons and uncommons from around Tempest. No dual lands or power, but about $700 worth at the time of selling.

As for Pokémon, I had no idea. I recognized characters: Charizard, Pikachu, Diglet… but I got a welcome excuse to call another friend who I knew collected them. He helped me understand what to look for and what was hot at the time. And if he had the money, he would have bought the collection right then and there. Many of the cards were holos, a term I had a hard time with at first; I was so used to MTG “foils.” Fully unpacking the depth of his collection took me weeks and months.

* Dozens, if not hundreds, of his cards were First Edition and/or shadowless.
* Dozens of the holos were base set.
* Banned Misty’s Tears art.
* Red cheeks Pikachu error.
* Grey stamp First Edition Raichu.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Selling Process**

After all was said and done, here are the final numbers:

* **Total Paid:** $1,437
* **Total Sold:** $2,936

The initial deal was I would sell it for him and give him 65% of all profit. I eventually learned I undersold myself. The last of his cards sold last April—a *four-month* process—and towards the end I resorted to selling everything left over in lots. Around halfway in, I paid him the agreed-upon 65% for everything sold so far, along with a flat price for everything still unsold. In the end, I paid $1,437.

Additionally, around a month in, I organized a trade with the friend I had called about Pokémon. I sent him all of my holo rares in exchange for around $800 worth of mostly modern-era cards. I'm open to other views here, but I think it was a win-win. He shrunk 60 sales for me down to about 10, and he got to trade me mostly modern-day hotness for valuable, more future-minded old stuff. (He also learned why *yes* it is important to secure the top of a top loader.)

Here I get to the heart of why I wrote this up. Given my sales, one could argue that my friend’s collection was worth about $3,000. But there is so much hidden in that word “worth.” He ultimately received—by selling directly to a collector he’s personally friends with—about 50% of the value. The only way he could have *actually* liquidated his collection into $3,000 cash would be by piecing it out and selling it himself. Like I did.

Let’s start by breaking down the sheer cost I paid. Every card needed at minimum a penny sleeve, top loader, piece of painters tape, team bag, envelope, paper, piece of packing tape, and First Class stamp. More expensive cards and card lots demanded bubble wrap, a variety of boxes and larger envelopes, and soft and hard acid-free plastic protectors of various sizes.

* **eBay fees:** $320
* **Shipping costs:** $226
* **Handling costs**: $130 (protective cases, bubble wrap, envelopes, etc.)

If I subtract it all from my profit, I’m left with $823. Not retirement material. And not passive income either—let’s talk labor.

I made 102 separate sales, along with plenty of failed sale attempts. This is at least a full workweek. And just in case you’re skeptical: Every sale requires photographing the card(s), uploading them, downloading them, editing them, researching price, creating the listing, categorizing the listing, writing the listing, often re-listing the listing, packing, weighing, measuring, printing a label, attaching the label, bringing to the post office or scheduling a pick-up, and dealing with (occasionally dreadful) buyers—which I’m very conservatively rounding to around 20 minutes per sale. That comes to around $8 per sale and a wage of $24 per hour. All things considered, not awful but definitely not trivial.

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuating Your Collection**

I do not believe there is a right or wrong way to engage with the hobby of card collecting. Modern flippers, vintage investors, and kids who dream of binders full of tiny artistic game pieces are all valid in how they define themselves in part by the collections they have. However, I *do* believe there is a right and wrong way to invest in cards if that is a part of the hobby that interests you. Actually liquidating cards into cash matching their collective value took me dozens of hours, a timeframe of four months before realizing the final dollar, and spending nearly $700 in fees, shipping, and handling. And I was starting with an eBay account that already had 500+ feedback with 100% positive!

When you bring your $3,000 collection to a store and they offer you $700, it is because the amount of work required to properly liquidate a $3,000 card collection literally requires full-time employees. Cards *can* be an investment, but do not trick yourself into thinking that $3,000 worth of cards is just like $3,000 in the stock market.

As soon as you start keeping cards that sell for under, say, $50 online, you aren’t doing it as an investment anymore. You’re doing it for you. Actually getting the full cash value when you're ready isn't clicking a few buttons, it's taking on brief part-time work.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’d Do It All Again**

I played *Magic* in elementary school and collected baseball cards in middle school and have loved cards of all kinds for as long as I can remember. The reason why I agreed to this labor in the first place—besides how cool it was to learn about the world of Pokémon cards—is because I didn’t have to sell a card. They were now mine. If I wanted, I could keep them.

So here I disclose what I alluded to earlier. There were a few cards that I chose not to sell but personally collect instead.

* Two First Edition Pokémon cards (grey stamp Raichu and graded Ampharos that was part of my trade)
* Five Reserved List Magic cards (Replenish; Eladamri, Lord of Leaves; Masticore; Donate; Recycle)
* A few Garbage Pail Kids cards

I'm not sure I would classify any of these as *amazing* investments, though I’d argue it has a few decent candidates. But that’s the thing. I’m not a card store!! I’m a collector and a player.",In case you're interested: my experience selling a card collection

"Just wondering where the members of this sub who sell Magic cards (either as a living, as a hobby or just to clean up their collection and make a little cash on the side) generally sell their cards at. Are you a TCGplayer seller? Does Ebay work better for you? Do you have a local Facebook group that actively buys, a favorite store site/LGS with good buylist prices?  

I've been playing Magic for about 20 years. I'm thinking I'm going to keep my Commander decks, just in case, but I really need to sell everything else. I've been keeping up with prices for most of this year, but I've been too afraid to sell because I don't know the best option and that's come back to bite me a few times, as some valuable cards I owned have seen their prices crashed due to Wizards constant reprinting and countless special edition promos, secret lairs, etc.  For someone who's getting out of Magic and is wanting to sell a bunch of high value and medium value cards, what do you think is the best option? My LGS will only pay pennies for cards and also doesn't buy singles unless they have a customer specifically wanting the card. So I've been leaning towards either TCGplayer or Ebay, but I've heard pros and cons for both.  

I hope this post isn't in violation of the rules.

"As of late there have been a whole rash of incidents with people getting ""repacked"" Boxes of product from Amazon that were looted then returned. While the fault for these incidents obviously lies with the assholes who are scamming people, it's worth noting the environmental conditions that are fueling this rise.

WOTC/Hasbro have been releasing MTG Boosters and Boxes for decades. And while the shift to Amazon selling is newer, Target, Wallmart, and other Big Box stores have been selling packs for quite a while. In the past, however, the overwhelming majority of products had a pretty low marginal value for opening. Nobody looked at a set like Theros and went ""It would be worth my time to buy a box, open all the packs in it, take the value cards, and reseal it"". While people did occasionally steal promos and the like from products at Target, it was the domain of children and the odd greasy kleptomaniac. Meanwhile, higher value products like From the Vault, and Masters sets they were exclusively sold through the usually incredibly secure limited scale LGS route. While people *did* try to sell things like resealed Modern Masters on Ebay, it was almost always in a sketchy ""re-sell"" capacity on an irregular basis.

That is not to say that there did not exist a culture of scamming around MTG, though. In particular, counterfitting of RL cards has been a long running practice, predating even widespread online card sales. 


What we are seeing now, however, is a shifting in economic incentives that has not only brought old-school scammers into the new-sealed product market, but which has created a market that has brought potentially profitable scamming to the wider MTG market. 

With products like collectors boosters being sold *everywhere*, and carrying both high price tags and decent marginal value, it is both easy and profitable for assholes to raid packs for value, then dump the product back into the supply to eliminate personal costs. 

**So why does this matter aside from ""don't buy from Amazon?""**


**Because the fundamentals suggest that the problem is going to intensify**

The value of set raiding has only gone up with sets like Time Spiral Remastered and Modern Horizons II Collectors Boosters, relative to Eldralaine Collectors Boosters and Theros Beyond Death ones. And it has gotten to the point where there is meaningful amounts of money involved. Stealing $60 (after buylisting) of value per box from an Eldralaine Collectors Booster is ""free time scamming"", stealing $120 (after buylisting) of value per box from MHII Collectors Boosters means looting 5 Boxes pays the same as a 40 hour workweek at $15 an hour. 

And so just like MTG card Counterfitting went from guys in their basement with Inkjet printers to Chinese Counterfitting Operations with Industrial machinery, ""Premium Price Set Resealing"" is poised to professionalize and routinize if it has not already. This will likely results in 3 key issues:

**1) A continued increase in the share of tampered with sealed product in the High Value Market**

**2) An expansion of tampered with sealed product into a wider spectrum of product lines. (If you're going to 1 off reseal a product you go for the highest value target, if you have a whole resealing operation and can get standard draft packs easy...)**

**3) Increasing sophistication in resealing practices. (If you're constantly shrink-wrapping resealed boosters, you're going to get better at it. This isn't like counterfeiting cards where WOTC has a ton of complex defenses already built in).**

"Following up on the piece I did a few weeks ago about overpriced and underpriced cards in MH2, I thought it would be worth revisiting the topic now that many of the prices have dropped (some significantly) and seem to be leveling out, or at this point very gradually trickling down. I'll take a look at those cards I mentioned first, then evaluate some other cards that I now think are overpriced, underpriced or correctly priced. Away we go:

**Overpriced from this** [https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/obm3bt/im\_looking\_at\_you\_mh2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/obm3bt/im_looking_at_you_mh2/)

Grief - At the time, Grief was TCG low of $20, and I thought it was overpriced. You can pick up a copy now for about $13 on TCG, and even less on facebook groups (I've seen it at 11). This feels about right. I don't think it's as powerful as people though. The turn 1 flicker trick was a really unlikely opening hand, and after turn 2 it's worse than Tourach. 

Kaldra - Was $11 at low, now about $8. I've actually come around a bit on this card as it's seeing a lot of play in D&amp;T builds. If it ever pops into hammertime as a 1 of, it could even go up. I imagine that as MH2 leaves print this might bump back up to $11+ as it's mythic. 

Damn - not much to say, it's like 2.50, which is exactly where it belongs. It might hop to $4-5, which is where I had it pegged once the set stops printing, but that's it's ceiling. 

Most other rares and mythics - I was mostly spot on here. I predicted Murktide would hold (it has), but I also said Dauthi and Ignoble would (they didn't), and everything else would pretty much be in the bargain bin (other than the underpriced cards...see below). I'm also not exactly Nostradamus here, it was pretty easy to predict a lot of this stuff falling off as EV balanced. 

**Currently Overpriced:**

I think we've reached the point where not too much is over priced. I'd be really hesitant to buy standard retro fetches. I'm just not sure there is a lot of growth to be had there. A retro Tarn is like $80, which outpaces even the old onslaught polluted delta and bloodstained mire by a good chunk. 

Solitude may or may not be. It's a solid card seeing play, but as a removal spell on a stick, always runs the risk of just having something better printed. I'd say it's fairly priced right now as a good mythic. If it went up or down, I wouldn't be surprised either way. 

EV and box prices have pretty much evened out, which means we will see some changes, but I think it will mostly be from some middling rares and mythics falling a little more as some other cards creep up. Then in 9-12 months we will see numerous cards trend upward. 

**Underpriced from previous:**

Endurance - this was a no brainer, it's actually increased while everything else dropped. It's around $24 on the low right now. It goes in legacy and modern decks, can be played in edh or Cedh, and pretty much is just a really really good magic card. 

Imperial Recruiter - I caught the most flack for this, and I'm standing by it. It's supported by the fact that as everything else has dropped, this has stayed pretty flat. I am most bullish on Borderless and especially Borderless Foil versions, but this is definitely bouncing back to being a $15+ card AND now that it's had a ton of reprints recently, should be free and clear for a while. Side note - I do think this is pretty much an immediate sell in 9-12 months as it is inevitable it will be printed in retro border. 

Cabal Coffers - I actually think all of them are underpriced now. At \~ $20 for the regular version, when this stops being printed they will go up to. Borderless foils are now about $70, and with the cool art and the fact that it's already been printed as a promo and in old border, I think there is LOTS of room to grow. There will always be new commander players, and in a year, those people will want Coffers. From a growth perspective, they are also always one card away from being completely broken in modern. 

Yavimaya, Cradle - Again, I'm confident on the long-term outlook here. It has continued to drop slightly over the past 2 weeks, but minimally. The caveat to this one is that I would definitely want the retro, retro foil or retro etch. I think the regular and extended versions will increase, but not nearly as much. 

Nettlecyst - Trending up and has never gotten as cheap as it was release weekend. That bodes really well. It will find more homes in different decks and it's awesome in casual commander where rocks are everywhere. 

Sword of H&amp;H - So on this one, I might have been wrong, but time will tell. I didn't foresee it going from $90 release weekend to $29. That's with it seeing LOTS of play in commander. Maybe there are too many versions, maybe it's that it can't be used anywhere other than maybe landfall with KOTR. If you can find a retro foil at $25, it might be worth a buy as the cheapest old border foil swords are all $75+. 

**Currently Underpriced:**

Everything above (except for maybe the Sword) + the following:

Dauthi Voidwalker - UMMMMM...it's really good. It's good in modern. It's good in legacy. It's good in commander. It's good in cEDH. In fact, it wasn't BB, it would be absolutely and completely insane. It's also now $8. I have been buying these up.

Sanctifier-en-Vec: It's good, it's being played, it's a rare, and it has an effect that will always be important. It WILL NOT be a .75 card. 

Fetches: Everything except regular retro. These are SOOOOO cheap it's ridiculous. I have personally purchased over 100 fetches. I'm most bullish on:

Pre-release foils. The stamp is cool. They are going to be REALLY rare. They look good (mine haven't curled at all), and it's the first time we've ever seen pre-release foil fetches. 

Foil Etched. Super cheap. Two scenarios - Wizards prints the allied in retro foil during the next MH set, which allows people to have a full matching set and drives prices upward OR wizards abandons it because it wasn't well received and these are the only retro foil fetches ever which...drives prices up. There is no way these aren't going up. 

Esper Sentinel - It was $20, which I thought was reasonable. At $11-12 it's fantastic and it's going to go upward over the next year. It's going to be a commander staple, it's cedh playable, it's in D&amp;T, it goes in humans, it can fit in artifact strategies. 

Cursed Totem - It was $20 two month ago. It is a commander staple. It is now .50 - $1. Zero chance it stays that low. It won't get to $20 again, but even at $5 it's a huge winner. If etched foil catches on, that version is the only foil ever of this card. 

Void Mirror - It's good, especially now, and it's like a quarter. 

Sanctum Weaver - My new pick for most undervalued card. This will be a commander staple, this will eventually find a home in a modern deck, and it will only get better as more enchantments are printed. You can get one for like $2. I think the foil extended that is going on Fb groups for about $5 is amazing. 

Asmo - I initially had it as properly priced. It's now way underpriced. You can get them for $1, it needs someone to figure out how to make it work with Hollow One or some other strategy.

So today I went to the post office and the guy came back with my package which was packaged in a standard small, priority mail box wrapped, except it was in a plastic bag. The postman told me they received the package damaged in this condition. The box looked mangled one half with some liquid damage done as if something broke and leaked onto it. By the looks of it, it looks like the box it was drenched in some sort of yellow liquid. 

Fortunately the guy told me I can take the package as it is, or they can send it back to whoever sent it. I didn’t mention anything about cards or anything that would indicate what was inside. But I did tell him that when I sent the package, I put $1000 insurance on the package so there was something of value inside. He said that he doesn’t know what kind of insurance is on the package and that the sender would need to make a claim.

I told him I wasn’t sure whether or not to take the package and asked if he could hold it for a couple of days in order to get it sorted out.

**Thoughts**

So my initial impression is that quality overall seems good and I haven't noticed any issues with foils or variants coming out damaged. Also, something I didn't mention last time, is that the Set Booster Boxes consistently provide more rares per box (37.38) than Draft Booster Boxes even with six fewer packs and significantly more foil rares/mythics (3.20). So while on the surface it may look like your are getting less product with a Set Booster the averages prove out.

Another question asked last time was the impact that List cards had when opening boxes for value. While we haven't tracked how many list cards we opened per box my impression is this: most list cards are trash that gets yeeted into the garbage when we open (hence why we don't track the actual number opened) BUT every box has at least one List card that is worth $20+ if not multiple. It doesn't really matter if 7/8 list cards in a box are unrepentant garbage if 1/8 is a banger like Cavern of Souls. 

This combined with the reduction in the amount of physical cards opened versus the traditional Draft Boxes while having a slightly higher pull rate for rares/mythics to me easily out weighs the additional costs of opening Set over Draft. While we had switched to Set Boosters given the current printing/supply issues with Draft Boosters for opening product I think the data and the reduction in staffing needed to process makes them the best option for opening singles and the change will be permanent for us. 

As always I've attached a link to our data below if you want to tease out your own insights and if you have anything you'd like to see in future posts let me know.

"Hello guys,

I am looking to acquire a full set of the Strixhaven Mystical Archive Alternative Japanese Art Cards (non-foil, foil etched or foil doesnt matter). After some research I found that I could get a full set of Foil Etched Cards for around 500 Euros. 

I also found a LGS which sells japanese Booster Boxes for 100 Euros each. Would it make any sense to buy 5 of these instead, sell Rares and Mythics that I do not need and then buy the missing japanese Mystical Archive cards?

Ripping Packs open is obiously a lot more fun, but I am worried about the resale value of japanese language cards. I also noticed that Strixhaven cards are not doing THAT great on cardmarket atm. So I fear that I (as a private seller with japanese non-mythical archive cards) would have to undercut by a lot to be able to sell them for any value.

Since I travel to Japan frequently (obviously pandemic related currently not) I also checked some japanese stores for current buying prices and these were also not that great for standard japanese Strixhaven cards.

I really dont mind to spend an extra 100 or 200 Euros for ripping packs, but I absolutely do not want to end up spending 300+ Euros more just because I decided to rip booster packs.

"I am a top rated eBay seller for magic cards. I also own an LGS. Recently eBay changed their policy so that all magic and Pokemon cards listed on the site have to be listed under condition used.

I just wanted to post eBay's response after I contacted their customer service. The below is a direct message from the chat agent.

"I remember when [Reflections of Littjara](https://scryfall.com/card/khm/73/reflections-of-littjara) was spoiled, thinking, ""This card will probably end up being good long-term."" Based on commentary I've seen from the EDH community, they seem largely impressed by it. But currently it's still a bulk rare. I'm curious how all of you feel about it.

Let's get the negative out of the way first: It a non-mythic, in a Standard set, post-collector box, with the extra bundle printing. All of these factors will stunt the price growth of everything except maybe the FEA.

But long-term, here's what I think's going for it:

* *Tribal:* A theme that's popular with newer and established players alike, anything playable in tribal tends to end up better than a $1 rare, especially when you get to choose the creature type.
* *Card Advantage:* While it's not literal card draw, getting a second copy of a relevant creature is as good as having drawn a second copy of it and casting it.
* *Cheating Mana Costs:* Not only is it effectively drawing you a card, it's effectively ramping you at the same time. The two cornerstones of EDH! Granted, blue tribes like Merfolk, Pirates, Rogues, Spirits, Faeries, etc. tend to feature smaller creatures.... but even getting an effective 3 mana out of it every time you cast a 3-drop is mana advantage that slowly accrues. And there's always Sphinx tribal.
* *Combo Potential:* I'm not the combo type, but this card just feels ripe for a combo at some point. Even if there's nothing currently printed that's crazy with it, with the rate WotC keeps making broken creatures with insane ETBs, I can only imagine a future when this sort of effect gets broken.

It is comparable to, if decidedly weaker than, [Kindred Discovery](https://scryfall.com/card/c17/11/kindred-discovery) (both are enchantments, 5 CMC, mono-blue, with ""choose a type"", and provide card advantage). Discovery has the upsides of working with both blinking and attacking, drawing you far more cards from a single creature than Reflections ever will. And it can provide benefit the turn you cast it without further mana investment, as long as you have a creature to attack with. But Reflections has that ""cheating mana cost"" aspect, which shouldn't be downplayed.

To be clear, Discoveries is a $30 card, and I'm certainly not claiming Reflections will ever be worth that much (nor do I think Discoveries is worth that much, tbh; it has a lone printing in C17 and will tank with a reprint). But I do think $1 is undervalued. I see Reflections in the $5-$10 range if it's as good as I feel it is.

Put another way: Reflections is to Discovery as [Monologue Tax](https://scryfall.com/card/c21/19/monologue-tax) is to [Smothering Tithe](https://scryfall.com/card/rna/22/smothering-tithe). Tax will never be Tithe, but it's still a good value engine (as evidenced by its $7 price tag). That's how I view Reflections relative to Discovery.

For those who have played with it, what's your assessment of the card?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Full disclosure: I bought a couple extra playsets, because I like blue, I like tribal, and I'm one of the few weirdos who still likes and plays 60-card casual, not just EDH! LoL.

"I'm curious about people's preference for ungraded vs graded RL cards. I'm also curious if you think certain cards are worth it and others aren't. 

My general opinion is that I always prefer ungraded mint/nm RL cards because I like to hold the actual card, not some clunky piece of plastic, and I like to marvel at the perfection of an old, mint card without all the protection in the way. 

With that being said, I have what I think to be gradeable mint, BGS 9.5-10 (maybe?) quality RL cards from ATQ up to Urza's Block. I prefer to keep them ungraded, and expect some buyers will want them kept that way, but curious if other people think it's worth it to get them graded in the future to command a premium price? As in, would you pay a premium for graded mint, or do you prefer ungraded, true mint cards if you can find them? I'm finding it more and more difficult to find ungraded RL cards from old sets, so wondering if ungraded will actually become more difficult to find over time.

Finally, I'm aware that grading has been suspended by major grading companies for the time being, so I'm not really looking for advice but more curious of people's preferences. Thanks for sharing your input!",Preference for Graded vs Un-graded RL Cards?

1. \[\[Sanctifier en-Vec\]\] - $1.01 : This is my top spec for this set as it is incredibly undervalued right now.

This card will be $10-20 2 years from now once the market dries up. 
2. \[\[Profane Tutor\]\] - $2.22 : Profane Tutor is an excellent card at $2 as it is pretty much a telegraphed demonic tutor. In my opinion it's just a better version of \[\[Diabolic Tutor\]\]. I can see this card being $10-15 2-5 years down the road.
3. \[\[Foundation Breaker\]\] - $0.43 : This card is being undervalued right now due to it being in the uncommon slot and the amount of bulk on the market right now. This card is seeing a lot of play across multiple formats and I see it becoming a staple in certain decks. It will be $3-5 in 6 months to a year. 
4. \[\[Tourach, Dread Cantor\]\] - $2.29 : Tourach is being underlooked right now due to the hype of other decks in the format. Once taxes see an uptick I can see him being playable in modern or other formats such as EDH. I see him being a $5-15 card given time.",Modern Horizons 2 Specs

"I have been asked this so let me clarify for everyone the cost increases for shipping products from Europe and from Japan to the USA. This is the cost for the finished products as well as raw material components used to print and package goods. 

During the peak of the COVID crisis in 2020, 20' ocean containers that move goods cratered to a low of $600 per container. Today, that same container is being sold on the secondary shipping market for $22,500. The issue comes down to the limited shipping space available owing to numerous COVID related shipping constraints. Even with paying up for expedited service, there is a still significant risk that goods can sit at origin port, customs, entry port, on the rail, at the truck yard, or at the destination. Couple this with the fact that paper products are very expensive to move because they are heavy and are classified in a higher cost category by the rails, steamship line, and truckers. Trucking costs have also increased by significant amounts in this same time. 

Airfreight rates are insanely expensive, largely because flights internationally are limited and with limited flights you get limited space. Limited space means there is more freight to move than space available and pricing varies wildly week to week. In 2019, you could see costs of $2.60/kg for airfreight and now you can see costs vary between $10 - $30/kg for the same service. 

It is likely that WOTC will seek to increase prices to cover some of these cost increases.",Are shipping costs actually going up for standard products?
"If anyone has noticed, the MTG market has softened. There are fewer sales and rapidly declining prices in many standard sets coupled with declining sales volume of the Adventures in the Forgotten Realms D&amp;D set. A primary driver of the current downtick in prices comes from ""investors"" seeking to curtail purchases of new sealed products and sell cards from cards from the primary CCG games (MTG, Pokemon, and Yugioh) to raise cash to pay as a result of experiencing losses in the Flesh &amp; Blood market. This will be a multi phase downturn over a prolonged period of time as people come to terms with their loses. This is likely to hit reserve lists specs of non playable cards and other specs the hardest and there is significant demand based price support for staples and reserve list playables.

I made a much hated posted a few weeks ago that money leaving the fake currency scam of Flesh &amp; Blood would cause selling in the primary CCG markets of Pokemon, Yugioh, and MTG. Remember, the Flesh &amp; Blood company has been claiming there was a healthy ""secondary market"" for Flesh &amp; Bloods cards long before any were printed and they continue to advertise this on their website to this day.  

It is important to put out into the public arena that the unwinding of the Flesh &amp; Blood fake currency scam will cause several down legs in the primary CCG markets as ""investors"" will sell high quality assets to cover losses in Flesh &amp; Blood ""investments"". 

""Investors"" have considered Flesh &amp; Blood a currency. ""Investors"" have taken Rudy's advice to keep ""money invested"" in Flesh and Blood ""like Crypto"". This is deliberate attempt to mislead people into thinking Flesh &amp; Blood is a currency. 

The problem comes when the market is no longer appreciating rapidly, the liquidity dries up and there is little to no ability to convert ""Flesh &amp; Blood"" investments to cash as there is no demand for the product outside of being a currency. This means that ""investors"" that have overspent or need to raise money will sell assets they can move such as high quality MTG, Pokemon, and Yugioh cards. 

 As the Flesh &amp; Blood prices deflate the ""investors"" that believed they were ""putting their money to work"" by having a large % of their net worth in Flesh &amp; Blood ""investments"" seek to raise cash so they can pay for things in the real world with real currency it puts additional downward pressure on prices.

"Has anyone noticed poor quality coming out of Strixhaven Collector's boxes? I opened one from a credible seller on TCGPlayer, but some of the foil stamps where shoddy. They also had a strong ink smell...

"I need help dealing with a problematic seller who claims with *absolute certainty* (lol) that the cards I received from them - and sent pictures of - in a condition dispute, are not the same cards that the seller sent.

The facts:

I bought 3 Near Mint copies of a ~$100 reserved list card from a vendor on TCGPlayer.

What they sent was one NM copy, one LP copy, and one MP copy. I immediately took pictures of everything, and sent the pictures to the seller pointing out that I would like the NM copy, but that the other two were not acceptable at all.

They claimed there was a mixup and that they must have sent someone else's 3x LP order to me.

We worked out a 2x NM replacement shipment along with a prepaid package to get their bad copies back. Lo and behold, their replacement copies arrived and they're even worse than the originals. What the fuck? So I took pictures of these again and at this point I just want to cancel the whole entire order. I show the pictures and tell them that I will just send back all 5 cards because I'm not interested anymore.

Their response? ""Those are literally not the cards I sent."" Which is obviously horse shit. I own exactly 1 other copy of the card which is in great NM condition that I ordered from a reputable vendor on the same day.

So anyway. I go to the trouble of making a VIDEO, showing, in great detail, each individual card that was sent as well as video of me packaging the cards into the package/label that they sent, as INDISPUTABLE PROOF that the cards went into the package and were sent exactly as I showed them, in a sealed and safe package - showing a tracking number. I linked them the video.

Their response? ""Just stop. It's pathetic, and unnecessary.""

[Full conversation](https://imgur.com/a/6jvmPBk)

I am afraid that, obviously because this seller is completely full of shit, they're going to open the package, take out the cards, then re-seal it and claim that I sent an empty package opening a false claim with TCGPlayer. Then I will have no cards AND be out ~$350.

"Does anyone think draft booster supply in more recent sets will dry up faster due to the addition of set boosters? In other words, does anyone believe there is a smaller supply of draft boxes due to the time it takes to also print the set boosters? Or do we think they just run the printers longer / print even more cards than prior sets to fulfill the addition of set boosters. I believe it's safe to assume set booster have eaten up some of the pool who used to buy draft for prior expansions. 

 I understand this is dancing on the 1. definition of this subreddit and might be deemed off topic, but I'm just trying to put together an educated guess for how the company has approached print runs? Maybe there are 20% fewer draft boxes in existence to make up for sets, or maybe they just place double the order etc... meaning theres way more cards out there for more recent sets.

**In conclusion / the reason I ask this:** If there's a logical answer to the above, we could in theory have a more educated understanding of long term appreciate of Core 2021 and prior vs Zendikar Rising to present. 

I specifically waited to post this question until a few days after asking for opinions regarding set vs. draft long term appreciation head to head. People overwhelmingly leaned towards draft boxes due to the added ""playability"" component from the actual purpose of the draft boxes themselves. If there are fewer draft boxes out there in recent sets, they should go up in value faster.

"For those who aren't involved in the sportscard market, BBCE stands for Baseball Card Exchange, which used to be just a regular sportscard store but over time became more widely known for its authentication service, whereby people send old boxes or cases of sportscards in order for them to be inspected and, if verified as authentic, shrinkwrapped with that designation.  It's hugely popular and provides piece of mind for the buyer and often a price premium for the seller.  It's as close to a win-win as there is nowadays.

It has been such a huge success in sportscards, I wonder why hasn't a similar service for TCGs like MTG or Pokemon been created?  Yes, in most cases the sportscard boxes are not sealed, making it so the packs can be accessed and assessed easily, but even more importantly such that the shrinkwrap seal of authenticity doesn't detract from actual factory shrinkwrap as would be the case with MTG or Pokemon boxes.  But there has to be a way around that, such as a tamper proof sticker or the like.

The service also could be used for Starter Decks, where fakes are rampant and the shrinkwrap would be less of a detractor.  And the ""from a sealed case"" service, which verifies that a particular box came from an authentic sealed case, could be useful for products such as Kaladesh, Aether Revolt, Hour of Devastation, Amonkhet, Battle for Zendikar, Oath of the Gatewatch, and even Japanese War of the Spark, where people would feel better knowing their box is from a sealed case, rather than one from a case where boxes with the chase cards have already been pulled.

Do folks agree this would be a useful service for MTG and other TCGs?  If so, why hasn't it popped up and do you think it ever will?  I realize that for silver age boxes and later which have the full seal it is likely not necessary; but for starter decks and older circle seal boxes, I feel like this could be useful.",Why no BBCE equivalent for MTG or other TCGs?
"Old-growth troll is clearly a powerful card.  Although it’s not outstanding currently in the standard format, in 2022 rotation, it may be better.  Of course, it is mostly confined to mono-green, so it will need some help from a supporting cast of players, especially after losing love struck beast, questing beast, guilded goose, among other great cards post rotation.  However, the overall power level of the format will drop dramatically after losing throne.  In the event that green receives a supporting cast over the next year and becomes tier one, and in-person play continues to accelerate in participation, the premium copy of the card could climb in price, drastically.  I was able to pick up about 20-30 copies for an average cost basis around 2 bucks a piece.  Worst case scenario, these sit around for a year and I still think they will be worth more than a couple bucks.  20-30 dollars is a reasonable target if it becomes a 4-of in a tier one standard list.  The risk-gain analysis leans heavily in favor of taking a 50 dollar risk for a 10-15x possible return.",Old-growth troll Foil Extended Art as a potential Spec
