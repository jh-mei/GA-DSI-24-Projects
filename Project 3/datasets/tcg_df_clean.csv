"So my dermatologist is trying to figure out why my fingers are being all weird, and told me to gather up things I touch a lot so they could test and see if I am allergic to them. I brought in a card because you know, I touch them often. I now have a piece of MTG taped to my back in the name of science, and thought you all might get a kick out of it. The guy preparing the test went above in beyond in terms of art direction.

"[

This is the latest update to my dual lands design that I've posted about. I've been calling them TATO's for ""two and two only."" I updated the names, some people didn't like ""Killing Field"" for the B/W one, ""Hot Springs"" it turned out was already used, etc. I also found better art I think for some, and also improved the wording so that you can't donate it to your opponent. Hopefully no one thinks this means that if you buy these you could never play those colors in any deck, haha. 

I also made them have the land types because three-color decks already have searchable duals, so for this to add strength to the intended deck types, I think they'd need to be searchable too.

I like to have the text box be as clean as possible, so if I could I would probably get rid of the reminder text, but if I do that on Magic Set Editor it removes the color background, so no dice. Otherwise, I think these would give me what I personally like in dual lands, including not having to keep track of how many lands you have, take damage, decide whether to play them tapped or untapped, while not having the ""guilt"" of being strictly better than basics or enabling decks that just play all colors. They seem to hit the right spot, at least for me. TATO Dual Lands 9/23 Update: A set of simplified dual lands that preserve the color pie."

"This is probably a really dumb noob type question, but if you use [[Oran-Rief, the vastwood]] to cast a green creature, can you ALSO use it at the same time to put the counter on the creature?  Since you are tapping it for Mana, but it enters the battlefield, I'm wondering if you automatically put a counter as well?  Or would you have to leave that land untapped and then tap it for that counter abilitiy?  I guess the same would go for [[Forge of Heroes]]. Question about Oran-Rief, the vastwood"

"So I just finished a match on arena with someone who was leaning heavily on Ice Breaker Kraken and a couple of 0/4 crabs that made you mill three cards whenever they played a land. (I forget the crabs name.)

This was a long drawn out match with a lot of back and forth.

I finally backed them into a corner by activating Lair of the Hydra's ability and tapping all of my land for an 8/8 hydra and attacking while they only had 7 life left.

They blocked my hydra with their kraken, but before damage they used it's ability to return three snowlands to his hand, and then also return the kraken.

So the way I would figure this would play would be that my hydra was now not blocked, and would continue to attack them directly.

But what arena did was cancel out the attack as if my hydra had been blocked, but neither creature took damage, the lands and the kraken went back to their hand, my hydra returned to a land, and the two other creatures that I had in the field were still locked down due the Kraken's other affect.

Is this how this should have worked, or did I get screwed by the game? Question about Ice Breaker Kraken's mechanics."
"So I have a few ideas for decks, and I need card suggestions to help along with it. I'm thinking of buying my boyfriends Shabraz/brallin deck from him, but instead of basing it around cycling, instead I want some insta-win card mechanics. I.e. triskaidekaphile, Jace wielder of mysteries, and the book of exhaulted deeds. I feel the constant cycling and drawing of cards would prove beneficial for shabraz, so that my deck works with or without my commander (my issue with his deck, played it and both my commanders got exiled or countered 5 or 6 times.)

Another deck idea I want to do is Atla Palani, with an infinite damage loop of mirror entity, ulamog infinite, and a damaging card (I currently have red dragon, deals 4 damage to each player when enters battlefield). Also planning on throwing in mask wood nexus, but I want other suggestions to add to it so it's not a round 6 instawin.

And lastly I want to build a land buster deck. I know it's frowned upon, but I'm fairly new and I'm tired of my friends deck, where he can put every basic land type in his deck on the field in one turn. (Not a joke, early game he managed to get 30 forests onto the field by round 8, not sure which spell he used)

And I'll also take suggestions for my adrix and nev deck, only major card I have in there is old gnawbone Need card suggestions (Blue white red commander?)"
"Could someone actually give me their point of view for playing in a casual setting and spending this much on what could be functionally and aesthetically replicated with a high quality printed picture?

I'm having a hard time finding what I'd consider solid cards in EDH under 10$. Extrapolating for a deck, that's a solid grand. And god forbid you want anything even approaching good and &gt;6 years ago. 50$+

I started out around 2002ish with Onslaught and got much more into it during Darksteel, even won a few tournaments with my modified Transference theme deck at the ripe old age of 12 lol. As well as rebuilding that deck from memory (sold my pairs of fire and ice/light and shadow ffs) I'm also looking to see what's new. My girlfriend and I picked up a couple Commander decks to get back in the groove but we have absolutely no idea where to begin.

"Howdy,

Ever since I started playing Magic, I’ve been rocking with DS Mattes and have adored them, but lately I’ve run into a bit of a quandary. 

I’m in the process of consolidating all of my stuff into as little space as possible, and have found that between my two EDH decks, two Modern decks, and a bunch of unsleeved tokens, everything fits perfectly (well, more on that in a moment) in some Ultimate Guard Boulders of varying sizes, which all fit *perfectly* inside an Ultimate Guard Arkhive; the satisfaction of putting them all in was immeasurable.

Now, as you probably know, DS Mattes are *thicc*, so much so that my (double-sleeved) decks are pretty crammed into their respective boxes, with barely any room for the relevant tokens that go with them to fit comfortably, so lately I’ve been wondering if it might be worth switching to Ultra Pro Eclipse sleeves. I know they’re slimmer, and I hear they shuffle better, too, but also get dirty pretty easily. Either I switch the sleeves, or get bigger boxes and prevent everything from fitting nicely in the Arkhive, because seeing the sad look on Karn’s face as I jam him into the Boulder is almost too much to bear. 

In any event I’d probably just switch my modern decks for the convenience of having those few tokens in the boxes; I can manage with the EDH decks since if I’m playing commander I’m probably bringing the whole token box, too.

Is this switch worth it? Anybody who’s used both, what do you like/not like about the Eclipses? I suppose I can always buy a pack and try it out at FNM tomorrow, but hopefully you fine people have some good feedback.

Thanks! On switching to Ultra Pro Eclipse’s"

This coming weekend (9/25) MTG@ Home will be hosting our first Commander event on this server!!!!!

We are dubbing it; The Tamiyo Tournament!! And in reference to this, there will be prize support, more prizes with more people. The event will take place across Saturday with games hopefully firing the whole time. Organization: The event will comprise of 2 ""Teams"" Blue and Green team, Participants will be randomly assigned to teams. Teams, however, will not affect gameplay. Placement in games will earn points for your team! (4 for 1st, 3 for 2nd, 2 for 3rd, and 1 for 4th). Team Scores will be tracked displayed for the whole event. In order to keep things casual and fun for everyone, we will be asking everyone to keep their team a secret until the end of the event. We will also be splitting the event into 2 separate channels ( **edh-low-mid-tamiyo** and **edh-high-tamiyo** ) to keep power levels more equal, but at the end of the day, play to have fun and to win! At the end of the event, The winning team will be crowned and winner roles will be handed out with a special role for the player with the most points. Prizes will be raffled out to the winning team at random in order to keep things competitive while also keep the stakes lower. Hope to see you all there!!

"I’m going to start making wooden deck boxes to sell. A while ago I posted a picture of a multi deck box I made for a friend with some really positive feedback. Many of you thought that a box big enough to hold 100 cards double sleeved would be the way to go.  So, that’s where I’m starting. Individual deck boxes at first, most likely followed by multi deck boxes. My plan was to make five single deck boxes at first and see how it goes. My question is, if you were going to buy a wooden box that held 100 double sleeve cards what would you want? Do you guys like to have a spot for dice? Custom carving? A window to see the commander? A spot for tokens? Or perhaps just a simple wooden box that holds just a deck? A second question; what would you think is reasonable for these? I’ve seen them as low as $60 and upwards of $120. I really appreciate any feedback. Thank you for reading! Deck box suggestions, what would you want?"

"Hi,

"One of my favorite parts of magic is the flavor, and one of my favorite part of red’s flavor is intense feelings. I’ve always though that this doesn’t get showcased enough outside of anger and rage. That’s why I’ve always loved Feldon of the Third Path. He’s a red card that encapsulates longing desire to be back with someone you can’t. The only other card I know in the limited amount of cards I’ve been exposed to that captures that essence of red is Cathartic Reunion. I would really like to see art on this card that shows Feldon and Loran uniting after she escapes Ashnod. What do you guys think? I think it is near the top of my list of card concepts I want to see printed. WoTC should have Seb McKinnon do the art on a reprint of Cathartic Reunion featuring Feldon and Loran during the Borther’s War set"

"How do we, as consumers, hold WotC's feet to the fire over their inadequate printing and materials quality standards? We've all discussed their curling cards, print errors and other recurring problems with the cards we receive. A side of it that I haven't seen discussed as much is what WotC customer service does about the problems, which in my latest case was ""not much"".

I recently received my Full-Text Lands Foil Edition. I may have been more excited about this product than most because of [my effort to make a full-text land]( a while back. I was blown away when u/ProfessorSTAFF mentioned my post in his video about this Secret Lair. So when I opened my package and saw my cards, I was devastated. All of my cards had the classic ""faded foils"" problem that was so common in Double Masters.

&amp;#x200B;

[My faded card between others I bought later. It looks even worse in person.](

So I contacted WotC support, with a photo and was brushed off. I took a better photo, and again I was brushed off. ""We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to bring your thoughts about your Secret Lair product to our attention."" I continued pushing the issue to no luck. WotC fed me the ""product variation"" line several times and would not replace my defective cards.

So what do we do when a product we love is produced at a quality standard we hate? If I boycott the cards then I don't get the pieces I want for the game I want to play. I don't want to boycott the artists who illustrate the cards, or the design team that makes the mechanics. My problems are with the printers, the quality control and the customer service.

I'd love to hear what people think about how to approach this problem, and how we hold the makers of our beloved game to a higher standard. ""Product Variation"" aka quality standards"

"Welcome to the Topdeck Thursday discussion thread!

*No one is going to want or be able to reply to every deck listed here. But please, if you're going to post something, please respond to someone else's deck as well!*

**While you're here, I'd like you to keep the following goals in mind. This thread should:**

* Provide a place where we can all post our current project in an open forum that encourages discussion.
* Encourage interaction of the community in an honest and respectful manner.
* Establish a regular framework for people to submit their decks for critique with a familiar user base behind it.

**A little common Courtesy!**

1. Decks should be posted as links to a site such as [www.tappedout.net]( for ease of analysis / viewing.
2. **Please no bare links, give us a little insight about what you're going for, or what you need help with.** If you've done some serious testing and you feel it'd contribute to the feedback process, list it! Gone 18-3 with a deck so far but keep losing to Esper Control? Tell us!
3. Downvote sparingly, if at all. Conflicting opinions deserve civil discussion, which in turn breeds new ideas. Bad advice should be corrected, and explained.  This is all about generating discussion and opening up new ideas.

**Yeah! what bokchoykn said!**

&gt;*Ask thought-provoking questions.* ""What changes should I make to this deck?"" is not thought-provoking. ""How do I improve my match-up against Esper Control decks without compromising my Aggro matchup too much?"" This is a much more interesting topic to discuss. Moreover, the advice that you get won't just apply to your deck but it can work with other decks of similar design and color. A lot of people can benefit from this.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Tell us very specifically about what you want.* What kind of deck do you want to have? What features are important to you? What level of competition do you play at? What decks are you facing? What is your desired budget? What is your maximum budget? This type of info gives us a lot more to work with. Simply ""Here is my deck. Help me improve it, please"" doesn't tell us anything and is difficult to respond to with anything constructive. Topdeck Thursday -- Ask /r/magictcg all your deckbuilding questions!"

It's cool to see that the art team does value that old-school (or at least older school) feel on some cards too.

In general Magic seems to be in a pretty good place art-wise for the moment, particularly since around Magic Origins I was seeing lots of complaints of the dire state of some of the computer-generated art we were getting on cards.

"I'm looking at some sacrifice decks because I think that concept is incredibly fun. Looking at a few in different formats and the main two seem to be centered around \[\[Witch's Oven\]\] or \[\[Bolas's Citadel\]\]. I don't understand why the Oven deck is immediately beat out by the Citadel deck once you move to modern from historic. The only card not allowed from the Oven deck is \[\[Phyrexian Tower\]\].

What about Phyrexian Tower makes not having it immediately make Oven deck go from the most popular sacrifice deck in historic to the Citadel deck being more popular in modern.

"Hi all - am looking to do a ~$50 upgrade to the Undead Unleashed precon and wondering if [[The Scarab God]] is truly worth getting as Commander to replace [[Wilhelt]]?

Clearly the Scarab God seems like a popular choice (although costs ~$12-14) but the latter seems like a decent value engine between the zombie tokens and the drawing engine. Would be keen to hear your views as I'm more than willing to bite the bullet if the Scarab is a material upgrade over Wilhelt.

"While looking for an interesting commander for a Myr tribal deck, I was looking for a commander to really create something janky. I decided it had to be 5 color as I wanted to include all the Myr mana dorks. What follows is the result of trying to force something to work through hours of hyperfixation to achieve an empty goal. Is there a way to win the turn I cast my commander with a board full of Myrs? Scientists deny this. But what is science to a madman?

So you start your board untapping with six lands, an assortment of 5 Myr dorks (one of which must be [[Palladium Myr]]), [[Training Grounds]], and a [[Sol Ring]]. It's important that with the dorks and lands you have you must be able to at make generate WUUBRG. In your hand you have to at least have Artificial Evolution and a flicker type of effect such as [[Cloudshift]]. It's important to remember that all abilities that are activated are reduced by 2 generic due to training ground.

Step 1:

&gt;First generate WUBRG and cast Scion of the Ur-Dragon from the command zone. Next, spend 1 Blue mana to cast Artificial Evolution targeting Scion, changing it's ability to say ""Artificer"" instead of ""Dragon.""

Step 2:

&gt;Tap Palladium Myr, Sol Ring and whatever combination of Myrs and lands to generate 4 more mana, generating a total of 8 mana. Then, spend 7 mana to activate Scion's ability 7 times, putting each instance on the stack. (Regardless of what creature it becomes a copy of, I'll just refer to it as Scion.)

Step 3:

&gt;Let the first instance of the ability resolve, searching your library for [[Oxidda Daredevil]] and putting it into your graveyard and making Scion a copy of it. Then, activate it's ability by sacrificing Sol Ring, giving Scion haste. There is 6 instances of Scion's ability still on the stack.

Step 4:

&gt;Resolve the next instance of the ability (5 left), putting [[Arcum Dagsson]] into your graveyard from your library, Scion becoming a copy of it. Tap Scion for it's ability, sacrificing one of your Myr creatures (that's not palladium myr) to search your library for [[Maskwood Nexus]] and put it on the field, making every creature you own all creature types.

Step 5:

&gt;Resolve the next instance of the ability (4 left), putting [[Pili-Pala]] into the yard from the library. Spend your 1 mana you have to activate it's ability, untapping Scion and generating 1 mana.

Step 6:

&gt;Resolve the next instance of the ability (3 left), putting [[Myr Welder]] into your yard from your library, Scion becoming a copy of it. Then, activate it's ability and exile Pili-Pala from your graveyard, gaining it's ability. Spend your 1 mana to then untap Scion and generate 1 mana.

Step 7:

&gt;Resolve the next instance of the ability (2 left), putting [[Myr Galvanizer]] into your yard from your library, Scion becoming a copy of it. Spend your 1 mana and tap Scion to activate it's ability, untapping each of the 4 other Myr dorks you control.

Step 8:

&gt;Resolve the next instance of the ability (1 left), putting [[Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero]] into the yard from your library, Scion (who is currently tapped) becoming a copy of it. Tap each of your Myr dorks (including Palladium Myr) to generate 5 mana. Lin Sivvi (which Scion is a copy of) second ability takes Rebels in your graveyard and puts them on the bottom of your library. Activate Scion's version of her ability 3 times (for 3 mana total), putting Myr Welder, Arcum Daggson, and the original Lin Sivvi from your graveyard to the bottom of your library.

Step 9:

&gt;Resolve the final instance of the ability, putting Myr Welder from your library into your graveyard, Scion becoming a copy of it. From my understanding, Since Scion originally exiled Pila-Pala when he was previously a copy of Myr Welder and Scion didn't leave the field since then (meaning, that he is still the same object, and has not become a different object like he would have become if he was flickered or something), Scion who is again now a copy of Myr Welder should still see and remember that Pila-Pala was exiled with it's ability, giving it Pila-Pala's ability. If I am correct and this is the case, the rest of the combo goes like this:

Step 10:

&gt;Scion, as a copy of Myr Welder, activates it's Pila-Pala ability, spending 1 mana to untap it and generate 1 mana. Then, tap Scion to exile Myr Galvanizor with Myr Welder's ability, gaining it's activated abilities.

Step 11:

&gt;Scion is now a copy of Myr Welder with the activated abilities of Pili-Pala and Myr Galvanizor. Spend your 1 mana to untap Scion and generate 1 mana. Next, spend that 1 mana to activate Myr Galvanizor's ability to untap each other of your Myr dorks. Tap all your dorks to generate another 5 mana. Spend 1 mana to again untap Scion. And from here, you can repeat this process over and over to generate infinite mana by constantly tapping and untapping all of your dorks and Scion.

Step 12:

&gt;Once you have generated infinite mana, cast your flicker spell (ex. Couldshift), exiling Scion and returning it to the battlefield. It will return to the battlefield as Scion of the Ur-Dragon as it was originally.

And then, obviously, with infinite mana your options are pretty open. One example of a line you could use is to activate Scion's ability a stupid amount of times. From there, you could make him a copy of Lin Sivvi again, put Oxidda Daredevil and Lin Sivvi back into the library, so that Scion can become a copy of Daredevil to give itself haste again, then become Lin Sivvi again. Then use her first ability to grab any creature from your deck. Grab things like [[Padeem, Consul of Innovation]] to protect your Maskwood Nexus from being removed. You could do something even more convoluted and stupid and use [[Pull From Eternity]] to put Pilia-Pala back into the yard, then into the library with Lin Sivvi, then loop using Lin Sivvi's first ability to bring a creature out, make Scion become Pili-Pala to untap itself, then become Lin Sivvi again to grab another creature to just bring every creature from your library on the field. Throw a Daggson in the mix and start grabbing all your artifacts from your library as well. Bring out [[Myr Matrix]] and create an army of Myrs to swing for the win. You could also be boring and just have Scion become [[Kenrith, the Returned King]] and mill all your opponents out.

With these 12 simple steps, you can force Scion of the Ur-Dragon to have a major identity crisis while being able to say you've won a game of commander with ""Myr tribal."" An extremely insane and convoluted Scion of the Ur-Dragon Myr-Tribal Combo"

"So, I live in Belarus, it's a country close to Russia, and we have a lot of similarities in market. And what happens here with foils is just mindboggling for me! If a card is foil, and in Russian, people sell it for 2-3 times the price of an english one. I've seen people selling 10$ cards for a 100$ because ""It's Russian foil!"" And they do provide evidence of pricing by opening Russian card selling auctions where it sells for this price (Recent example I saw, for reference - Foil extended art Grand Master of Flowers costs about 12$ on scg, but was sold for 6200 Russian roubles(About 85-90$) ) There are a lot of examples like that, and people actually telling players to never take prizes in English packs, because ""There's no money there! Oh, you'll open a foil fetchland, nobody's gonna buy it!"".
And I haven't seen anybody in Belarus caring about Russian foils, only the people talking about it and saying to sell it to Russia. I am really curious about this!
So, my question goes: 
Does anybody outside of Russians (and/or market people) care/like Russian foils and willing to pay 2-10 times more to have their cards in this language?
Thx reddit. Does anyone care about Russian foils outside of Russia?"

I've played Yugioh for ages, at this point I know the rules of Magic, but I'm trying to figure out how to pilot the deck better. I feel like every game I just get tempo'ed out as he gets a bunch of lands and big bunguses, I never really have removal (or the mana to use it when I draw it), and while I get in some damage early game I don't have anything that can take on his creatures by the time he's played his commander, dropping lands left and right, and is giving everything counters. I try to focus on playing artifacts and stuff that gives mana asap, I'm trying to attack and get in when my creature won't just obviously get blocked and killed, and I'm trying to get my commander on the field earlier so I can start drawing cards, but I'm sure there's some gameplan in the deck I'm not utilizing the way I should.

"Original post [here]( 

Hey all, first of all, holy cow, I didn't expect that much attention on my earlier post-- I thought I'd get one or two comments that were medium-to-low degrees of helpful as usual but you guys ate it up, so thanks. 

Staring at the card all day and reading your comments, I ended up saying ""fuck it,"" cutting my losses, and decided to go big or go home. A lot of the advice, though good and very much appreciated, ended up feeling like half measures-- either not being strong enough, or taking several weeks to months.

You have no idea how bad it smelled. Anything short of a chemical bath felt like not enough.

So, having newly found out about \[REDACTED\], I decided to go for an \[\[anguished unmaking\]\], and peel her fucking face off. I had tried it out on some cheap cards, like an old \[\[akroma's memorial\]\] and a \[\[book of exalted deeds\]\], and had some moderate success with them, so I went for it with Avacyn. 

Also added some soap to her soak to get all the little cummies out.

And the results? [Here]( Pretty damn close to perfect, and even so, a hell of a lot better than how it started. The card's pin straight now, AND smells like lavender. Only thing is I couldn't get the wrinkles out 100%, but now they're barely there. Not like I'm ever gonna get rid of this, anyway.

Anyway, thanks all for the help, all. And yes, I'm kidding about which cheap foils I used.

And now, into the jar it goes. [UPDATE] Just bought a card from ebay and it smells RANK"
"I'm getting back into magic after a long time and wasn't really all that versed to begin with.

Is there anywhere to get some deck building guidance based on the cards I have?"
"blue's counterspells are getting ridiculous. They answer too many problems, some of them cost no mana, others untap lands and some are just really damn cheap.  


you could have baral as a commander with mostly counterspells and win games that way  


""playing around the counters"" is not counterplay. You need counterspells to counter their counters or have uncounterable spells which is primarily in green  sometimes red   


and even if your spells resolve blue can bounce, destroy/exile or steal them.  


How is this color even remotely fair? It's getting to the point where you have to put blue in your decks just to stop blue and I don't think that's healthy at all. if you are not playing green or blue then you're going to have a hard time."

Then for some reason I was able to cast the top card or the Sacred Fire in my bin for its Flashback cost with Chandras ability, which I did to see what would happen and it just cast it and the Sacred Fire didn't exile itself.

"Hi all, I got a heavily played, SUPER curled judge edition of \[\[Avacyn, Angel of Hope\]\] from ebay for a good deal that I thought I might be able to rescue. When I got it and was walking back from the mailroom, it actually looked pretty good, in a hard case, double sleeved. There was a little indication of grease(?) in the description box, but nothing too bad. The Howard Lyon art looked awesome, the foiling really accentuated it, and I was super hype to have my grail card.

Then two things happened.

(1) When I got home and took it out of the case and sleeves, the first thing I noticed was the smell. Now, first off, I have NEVER had a card that smelled bad. And this one smells like NOTHING I've ever smell before. It's absolutely RANK, and anyone within a couple feet of you can smell it. My girlfriend took a whiff and had to run to the bathroom cause she almost threw up.

Imagine balls on a humid day, plus rancid man nut, and for good measure, a swipe or two from a 13 year old's armpit. Then pickle it.

I cannot put into words how bad it smells. Even when double sleeved, I get some nasty whiffs here and there from it. So now I don't know what to do. I honestly don't even want to touch it. 

We joked that the previous owner was nutting to Avacyn and now I have a nagging thought that it might be true... it WAS super super curled, after all.

Which brings me to the second thing:

(2) I tried to uncurl it. STUPID. I'm still kicking myself for this-- no issue w the seller, this was all 100% my fault. I saw a video where a guy wrapped it in the opposite direction of the curl around something round, which seemed to work for him, but it ended up with mine getting some crinkles/folds/lines ? 

And they don't look too bad at certain angles, but at others they're pretty noticeable. [Here]( a picture. (I have it sitting on top of a candle in the other room right now, hoping it loses its musk.)

Any advice for these two issues? Literally anything would be much appreciated. Just bought a card from ebay and it smells RANK... and has CRINKLES. any advice?"

"Hello, 

As we head into the Holiday season in the next few months, I want to get a few items off of my shopping list and wanted to get some insight on what methods you use to acquire custom art prints/canvases for MtG artwork. 

I am looking to get a big canvas of Adam Paquette's ""Innistrad"" (Art book cover piece) and INPRNT, the company Adam seems to be partnered with, will only do a small canvas of 12x24, whereas I'd love to get one closer to 24x48 - double the size. 

I want to support artists and start decorating my new gaming space with lots of artwork, but I haven't found a company/organization that will work with me much on printing at dimensions that make sense for the room they're for. 

Anyone have any good suggestions? What's worked for you? Ways to Acquire MtG Art Prints?"

"Im in a logic loop and need some help breaking out. It seems like obviously if you spend one card and get two cards (like Weave Fate, 3 and a Blue to draw 2 cards) then you spent one card and got 2 cards. So you are up one card. But lets say you drew Colossal Dreadmaw. Would you not be better off just playing an extra copy of Dreadmaw and skipping the draw spell and the 4 mana it costs? Like if you only net one card, isnt it always better to just draw that card organically instead of spending a card to draw 2 cards?

"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently tried out Dragon shield's new Standard Sleeve customs on my EDH deck.

While I'm aware that the artwork is printed directly onto the sleeve and could absolutely play them as is, I did the extra thing and got over sleeves (or card protectors) to sleeve over them.

This has now resulted in the issue that none of my deckboxes will fit my deckboxes. The length of the deck is not an issue but rather the width is not standard for deckboxes.  

The estimated dimensions of the cards in the sleeves are about  68 x 93 mm.

It's only shy of an actual triple sleeved deck but yeah its sizeable.

To be clear, these are **NOT** \[Perfect Fits + Standard Size\], my sleeves are \[Standard Size + Oversleeves\] 

(I came from a different card game that double sleeved normally, so it's kinda hard to not oversleeve anything with artwork) 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any suggestions or advice (outside of not oversleeving) for deckboxes, it'd be greatly appreciated since my only solution at the moment is using an actual 200ct cardboard storage box. Non-Traditional Double Sleeve Deckboxes available?"

"So I looked around and didn’t see any format like this and I think it be a great  format. 

You play a limited event and you now want to play but are overwhelmed with choices. You don’t know what style you want to play or what format. But you do have some cards that you got from the limited event. 

Enter Reaper a 40 card singleton format consisting of only cards from the latest set. Which currently would be MID. You build your deck and play it out. 

Some advantages are you can build a deck or two for very cheap and sell off the few cards you did buy when the next set comes out if need be. Or they are likely the stronger cards you would use in other formats. 

The cost is generally going to be lower as it is a singleton format and only 40 cards. Once you have your land base you don’t have many left to buy. 

Thought ?

TLDR: 40 card singleton format only including cards from the latest set i.e mid. Reaper - New Format?!"

"So I played FNM at my LGS and they had a chaos draft. We got a pack of D&amp;D, zendikar, and ikoria. 

I’ve never played a 1v1 format before FNM and I’ve never drafted before either. 

So we start drafting and I build an izzet board presence deck with some control elements. I ended up getting 3rd (would’ve won but I misplayed against the person who did get 1st, costing me the game). But the experience made me love 1v1 and inspired me to build a modern deck. 

This is the deck I’ve curated: 

I did research and looked up quite a bit of information on the current meta in modern. I saw multiple decks that seem to be “dominating” the meta. Out of those decks I liked the izzet variations the most. 

My deck was heavily based off that research although I don’t believe I saw a deck that was card-for-card exactly the same. I wanted to put the list here and ask for feedback—especially since I’ve never played modern. 

But the deck revolves around Darcy, MONKE, Murktide, and spells matters. The idea is to get off to a quick start, ramp using treasures, fill my graveyard and then cast murktide with delve to make big flying BOIS. 

The deck also has some control elements in counterspell and unholy heat—the latter having synergy with Darcy. Moreover I can burn with lightning bolt if needed as a finisher. 

Take a look and tell me what y’all think. Izzet Business: A Modern Deck"

" 

I'm a limited only magic player. I don't collect or keep cards when I'm done. (I give them away) My preferred format is draft but I also love sealed, so I always attend every pre release. I believe the rise of commander has just really hurt the overall skill level of your average magic player. Winning is nice but I'm very tired of constantly steamrolling players who seem to have no concept of how the actual game works.

Before commander was as big as it is now I would go against your odd kitchen top player but most people at the shops were dedicated standard or modern players. But Commander is now by far the most played format and it's to the point where I just destroy every person I play against while barely paying attention to what I'm doing. I did three pre releases for MID and only had one opponent who was pretty good. This wouldn't be so bad, as winning is nice but all these players also act like they're annoyed at me for winning and winning with no challenge gets very boring. I constantly get responses like ""well I guess I just don't care as much about magic as YOU!"" then when discussing the game with their fellow commander players after I hear stuff like ""oh I got mana screwed/he has a busted deck"" as to why they lost. When it's just the deck they built is filled with cards I'd consider unplayable with weird land counts. (One guy had a 53 card deck with 13 lands?!?!)

There is nothing worse than being told how to play and criticized by someone who is clearly worse than you. I don't want sound gatekeepy. People are free to play however they want. I understand magic has a steep learning curve as I was new to magic at one point too, but I always strived to get better and I think the casual nature of commander makes that less likely to happen for those players. They can keep playing however they want, and they can even come and get destroyed at every pre release, but don't come and then act like you're above it all. Understand why you lost and accept the fact you're not a good player because you don't care to become one.

I quit playing standard years ago and generally have grown to dislike the nature of constructed formats, but I actually hate commander. I think it's hurt the skill level of the community and what I like in the game. For those wondering, I have tried commander and it was just the worst experience I've had playing magic. The entire game boils down to ""I don't care about anything with the game, I just want to make all of you watch my cool combos"". The entire format is just self masturbatory garbage. This could all stem from the fact I'm a ""spike"" player and every commander player is a Timmy in Johnny cosplay, but I can't help how I feel. I want to keep doing pre releases but I've gone to three different LGS now and had similar experiences at all of them.

Am I being too hard on these people? Does anyone else feel this way? Any advice on what to do? Commander Is Making Pre Releases Less Fun"

"The return of in person paper events has aligned with the return of double-faced transforming cards.  Rather than constantly stretching the top of my sleeves to flip and reflip the transforming cards, especially the werewolves which can go through several transformations in a single game, I prefer to use the placeholder cards in my one sided sleeves while the actual double faced cards reside in a clear sleeve to the side.  I know that Sharpies tend to be the go-to for marking checklist and placeholder cards, but the lettering tends to be so thick that it is hard to get enough pertinent information onto the tiny card space, especially after a few uses when the pen's nib is not as sharp as it once was.

"Complain. To all you, who told me to wait spoiler season out, I wish a very pleasent f**k you.

So again, thanks for your eternal wisdom on the topic, and let's await crimson vow, where we'll get maybe two new werewolves that can be used for basicly nothing, and just to be fair, let's print like 30 vampires in the main set, and maybe 8 or so in the vampire commander precon, out of those let's make 10 insanely broken, and than just wait out the Twilight Saga crossover, where fans shall get 4 vampires and a werewolf that surely won't be red or green, because why not.

"So, we all know that WOTC does not want fetch lands in standard again, because of what it did to the format. But! Fetch lands in standard made them less costly, more accessible to players, because it was a widely printed, normally-priced set (and the Khans block was just a whole lot of fun).

What if WOTC printed allied-fetches in a standard set, like Khans, and just immediately (maybe even before release) banned them for play in standard? Is that a thing? Would they do that? I feel like that way, every player still has access to them for Modern decks, legacy, EDH, etc. And, I believe fetches are the best lands in MTG. So why not make them more accessible to everyone?

I talked with my playgroup about it and they said they'd be okay if WOTC did something like that but I just wanted to see what other people think (as I don't play standard so I'm not really sure of the current climate of the format).

"Im new too the game started about a week ago through arena.
But have been out to the shops and bought a booster deck of the DnD cards 10 packs and dice ect ect.

I was wondering if anyone had any tips for a newbie?

I have watched a few YouTube guides ect.
And im going to try and get into the local shops playing days to play some people who have played for years.

But yeah tips from you wonderful people would be great

I.e good decks best to play for a noob ect.

Thank you in advance! New to the card game OMG 😲"
"Is the quoted phrase grammatical? It is found in many magic cards such as [[interpanar beacon]].

I am no native speaker but as far as I know the way English works mana should be either uncountable (in which case two mana is incorrect) or countable (in which case two manas would be correct). ""Add two mana"" and English grammar"
"As an example, let's take [[Rowan, scholar of sparks]].

Let's say you need 4 in your deck, and you use 4 MDFC tokens in your deck. At any time you'd only ever have one Will and one Rowan on the battlefield, so if you have two more, you're never really gonna put them on the battlefield from your DFCboard.

If they die, the token goes into the graveyard, and the card goes back in your DFCboard.

So is there any situation where you'd need all 4? Would you ever technically need more than two MDFC legendaries, if you're using the helper tokens in the deck itself?"

"This is a deck I've been putting together as a background project, and I finally have a first draft of the deck.

*It is not a cedh deck, but it has some higher level/more annoying game plan.*

It's a totally normal human tribal with Chromium as the commander, but I have three combos built into the back of it:

1. 

[[Teferi, Who Slows the Sunset]]
+ 
[[Lithoform Engine]]
+
 [[Palladium Myr]] or [[Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx]]

Outcome: infinite life and Mana alone, but with other options on field possible infinite draw and game enders. 


2.

[[Arcanis the Omnipotent]]
 + 
[[Mind Over Matter]]
+ 
[[Laboratory Maniac]]

Result: arcanis finds lab man if they're not already on the field, then mills self and wins with lab man. 


3. 

[[Lethal Vapors]]
 + 
[[Teferi's protection]]
 + 
[[Tithe Taker]] (to be replaced by [[Grand Abolisher]] at some point)

Result: by skipping infinite turns, and making sure our opponents don't with Tithe Taker, we immediately cast teferi's protection. This means we phase out for as long as it takes for our final opponent to deck out, given theyre not playing lab man effects. This takes some planning and predictions. 


The latter combo is purely for a funny ending to the game rather than an every game thing. Kind of a ""if it happens it happens"" situation where did it's possible, I'll do it. Otherwise not. 


Would love some info and feedback on the first draft. This is purely made of cards I already own, but I'm willing to look into buying more.
 

 Welcome to: Chromium's totally human tribal deck!"
"Hey all,

I work in a school that caters to international students and has a small residence program with international students at varying levels of English comprehension. This year I have *finally* found that I have some students interested in MtG, and so our 'Friday After School Magic' club was born.

So far I have been teaching the game and letting the students play with the cycle of M21 starter decks I bought last year hoping to teach it while they were stuck on campus during COVID lockdowns, but even that was a no-go. I've got enough students interested now that I need more decks, so I went to pick up some newer Starters only to find... they aren't made any more?

I kind of get the WHY, but it's really killing my current plan of spreading the MtG love and having a decent selection of decks for students to try out. If I wanted to teach Commander I'd be absolutely SET with all the available pre-made products, but that's not a great 'teachable' format.

So my question to you all is - is there an effective way to put together/purchase some lower-cost pre-made decks out of the recent sets? I really feel like I'm just missing a product line here. The only thing I could find was the 'MtG Arena Starter Kit' which added 2 decks to the club collection.

Thanks! Starter Decks out? Easy pre-made teaching tools for school club?"

"So here’s my theories about Streets if New Capenna.  The five demon crime families will not be wedges or shards but a mix of both.  Demons are black mana but organization falls under the purview of white and blue mana.  Subsequently the Esper and Grixis shards plus the Abzan, Mardu and Sultai wedges give us the black mana for demons with white and or blue mana to be organized.  If this is accurate I believe each family will focus on a different criminal enterprise.  

Esper gives white and blue the most organized combination and the Esper family would likely deal in corruption of government and institutions to control things.  The red and blue of Grixis both have the ability to steal a creature from opponents and so the Grixis family may be involved in human trafficking.  White and green are the colors of community so Abzan family is probably the protection rackets.  White and red are the most militant colors so the Mardu family is likely muscle for hire, i.e. hitmen and paid assault.  Finally, blue and green combine science and nature which leads me to believe the Sultai family controls the drug trade.

Mechanics wise I haven’t thought up how all of these families might operate but I have ideas for a couple that make sense.  The Abzan protection racket may take the form of  permanents that grant protective abilities such as Protection from, Hexproof and Indestructible so long as a cost is paid each turn but which harm your units if you don’t pay for their protection.  The Sultai drug ring could have permanents that provide a temporary bonus followed by a lasting penalty, such as providing a large bonus to power until end of turn but then putting a -1/-1 counter on the creature.  Thoughts? Streets of New Capenna speculation"
"[[Underworld breach]] [[shaman's trance]]

"I'm posting this so that people see that the moderators of this sub are encouraging an open discussion about this topic, since many people believe that they censor people who are opposed to the idea of a vaccine mandate for in-store magic events.

I just saw [this post]( and since it is apparently not against rule 8 and 2 to talk about this topic I thought that I'm also going to share my opinion about this topic. 

I am all for the idea of masks in stores since they appear to prevent transmission for a reasonable amount and requiring them for in-store events is a good idea if the incidence is rising or very high. However I'm against the idea of a vaccine mandate because it's everyone's personal choice to get vaccine or not. Everyone should be able to weigh the risks and benefits of the vaccine and decide for themselves if they feel the need to get it or not, especially since your own safety isn't affected by the vaccination status of the people around you. If you got the vaccine then you are protected. Wizards should not have a vaccine and mask requirement for in person events"
"So I play draft with 2 friends. Typically one of them will buy a display, then share 3  boosters each  for the draft round, and then take away the cards at the end. 
Now, I never buy displays, because I really don’t want to own all those cards, since  I don’t have the need for a huge collection, and only want to buy singles for constructed play. 
What I usually do is I pay 2 Euros for the friend who is providing the 3 boosters. They say I shouldn’t pay at all, but I think that wouldn’t be fair, and  I feel like I am actually not paying enough. 
Really the formula I am looking for is: value of the cards in the boosters minus the value of having fun playing with those cards temporarily. 
You guys have any creative ideas how to settle this?

"Hello! I typically do budget deck building in Golgari colors, and for the first time in a while, something outside of that caught my eye. I think the zombie precon at base is already pretty decent, but with a few upgrades it goes from a good precon to a fun mid-high power deck. 

Of course, with a rooftop storm available, I couldn’t not add Gravecrawler. I leaned a bit into that combo, adding a sacrifice sub theme with stuff like Zulaport Cutthroat, and Plague Belcher. However, the deck is still mostly zombie tribal and beatdown. 

I limited myself to $50 in additions, which means no Cyclonic Rift or Rhystic Study. The commander also changes from Wilhelt to The Scarab God, though Wilhelt is still in the deck as one of the 99. 

Feel free to comment any suggestions you might have. I haven’t built in blue before, so I may have missed a few good budget cards.

"What I mean by the in-between staple pseudo cycle are based on [[Murder]], [[Cancel]] / [[Counterspell]], [[Shock]] / [[Lightning Bolt]].

Murder outright kills any creature with no downside but costs 3. But Infernal Grasp shows 2 mana kill anything with no downside is something they won't print.

Likewise Cancel is pretty bad, but Counterspell is too powerful.

We can do better than Shock but Lightning Bolt is too much.

Wizards keeps printing cards in between baseline core set versions and too OP for Standard versions. These cards usually have upsides and downsides compared to either end of the spectrum but are considered in between the power level.

White has 1 card they keep printing that could really use this treatment. [[Banishing Light]]. 3 mana for this effect is too much in most Standards even if it is super flexible. 2 mana versions with conditions or more downsides would be a great way to do something interesting with what's already in pie.

[[Borrowed Time]] felt like a huge missed opportunity.

We could have stuff like [[Journey to Nowhere]] that only hits creatures, something that only hits mana value 4 or less, something that only hits mana value 3 or more, etc. The most pushed version would be something like 2 mana hit anything and the opponent gains life equal to its mana value, kind of an inverse of Infernal Grasp.

But however far they go, doing these variants would make it more interesting than just printing another Banishing Light. White Should Get Its Own Member of the In-between Staple Pseudo Cycle"

""" Whenever this creature mutates, create a red artifact token named Feather with ""1, Sacrifice Feather: Return target Phoenix card from your graveyard to the battlefield tapped.""""  


This might sound like a dumb question but I can't find any clarification. From what i understand when a mutated creature dies it remains mutated in the graveyard. and if you resurrect it the creature will come into play but all the mutations separate into different creatures. That should mean that while Everquill Phoenix is in the graveyard it's still attached to all the other creatures/cards. The feather ability allows you to bring back a phoenix card, now if i use the token to bring back the mutated Phoenix will it bring back the just Everquill Phoenix (because that's the card being targeted) or will it being back the mutation stack (because all of those cards are attached to Everquill Phoenix? i assume the first option but i wanted to make sure Everquill Phoenix, Mutation question."
"Last night after piloting the deck 20 or more times (and winning a few times with alt wincons) my [[kykar, wind’s fury]] deck finally pulled off its janky win condition that I built the deck around which is burning out all of the opponents with giant x costed burn spells.

The deck itself i refer to as [[young pyromancer]] tribal because it includes all of the similar cards that can generate tokens from casting instants and sorceries. It then uses cards like [[arcane adaptation]] to make all of the random creature types into spirits which allows me to sac them to kykar to drop a bunch of mana into an x costed burn spell.

In this particular game I managed to stumble into a line of play which included activating my [[pyromancer’s goggles]], using [[saheeli, sublime artificer]] to make a copy of the goggles, and sacrificing enough creatures (including kykar himself because i had arcane adaptation out) to generate enough mana where casting 3x [[jaya’s immolating inferno]] did just enough damage to burn out the rest of the table before I would have gotten overrun by squirrels on my opponents next turn.

Where can I find examples of ""competitive"" zombie decks (if there is such a thing)? And by competitive I just mean solid so I'm having fun in online matches and not losing every game.  


Format I intend to play is standard.  


Thanks for any advice! Looking to build a zombie deck but how to get started?"

I'm new to semi-serious Magic, and have always been more of a collector than a real player.

"Saw [this post]( in the meme sub. Looks like a prerelease in a crowded room with poor ventilation and no masks. I’m vaccinated, but I would feel uncomfortable in such an environment given the current CDC recommendations. While the individual stores have a responsibility to host safe events, if they’re clearly not going to do so, Wizards has a responsibility as the provider of the product attracting people to the events. If they are going to ask people to congregate in person to buy and use their product, they should ensure that it is being done in the safest way possible. Other large companies are doing just such a thing such as Netflix having a mask requirement for taping specials even if the local venue does not. Wizards should have vaccine and mask requirements for events like prereleases and tournaments. Wizards should have a vaccine and mask requirement for in person events."

"I was (re)building old versions of decks I had for nostalgia, and when I finally finished reconstructing my [old pet deck]( I realized that the only cards that were in both decks were [[Whelming Wave]] , [[Quest for Ula's Temple]] , and [[Tromokratis]] . [(Current deck for comparison)]( I mean, it seems obvious, we tinker and improve our decks over time, but it's crazy to compare V 1.0 to V HD2.8FinalChapterPrologue and see how far the deck's gone.

"So before our prerelease got underway, a chap (we shall call him Steve) asked our playgroup if any of us wanted a 4 player EDH match. 

Me, Trevor, and Simon bring our decks ( [[Queen Marchesa]] , [[Osgir]] and [[Xenagos, God]] to the table, and our challenger uses [[Sythis]].

We only have 30 mins before prerelease packs are handed out, so we agree to a quick match. Xenagos takes this to mean taking any old hand and keeps a two land hand and contributes little to the game.

Osgir has a good opening game - artifact lands, rocks, [[Nettlecyst]] - he’s doing well. I get out [[Duelist’s Heritage]] and my commander, Marchesa. Our challenger, Steve, is a little affronted that I give Osgir’s attacking Nettlecyst double strike when it attacks his open board. “You guys are bullying me,” he says. I explain my deck rewards players attacking my opponents. 

The game develops. Osgir gets a formidable board presence. I have a few deathtouchers to discourage attackers. Xenagos finally gets his third land and makes a couple Saprolings. Steve gets out a couple enchantresses, and then drops [[Aura of Silence]] and [[Stony Silence]]. Osgir is suddenly frozen out the game. I continue to hold up mana for removal if needed to keep my Monarch crown. 

Suddenly, Osgir gets a mad turn and swings for lethal at Steve - which I grant double strike - and Steve is out the game. 

The turn cycles round once, and I [[Inkshield]] Osgir’s lethal at me, and I drop [[Gisela]] on my turn and kill my two remaining opponents.

Steve, our challenger, repeats that we bullied him, as we were all from the same friend group. Xenagos points out he contributed nothing to the game. 

I explain that Steve painted a target on himself the moment he played his Aura and Stony Silence, stopping Osgir from playing. “Well, don’t play artifacts then” is his response. “You still ganged up on me.”

I explain that my Marchesa deck has restrictive qualities in it - [[Sphere of Safety]] , [[Soulsnare]] , many deathtouchers- but these only create a pillowfort around me, while still allowing my opponents to play the game unhindered, but will have to spend extra resources attacking me. This means I’m not as much of a target.

I suppose my question to Reddit is: when you put blanket “players can’t do [x] effects,” are you prepared for how much this makes you the archenemy? Are you ok if players spend more resources to get you out of the game so that they can remove the restrictive effects? Were we unfair in removing him first (and keep in mind that two turns later, I had won). 
Have you found, like our challenger, that these preventative measures actually just goad your opponents into attacking you?

I think I want reassuring that we didn’t bully the dude, and that we played tactically and fairly. I’m also curious for players’ wider opinions on effects that prevent them from doing things and their experiences with opponents retaliating.

"I just went to Wizard's chest, unfortunately theyre sold out of prerelease kits but theyre selling booster boxes (no singles, though), so I asked what they were charging thinking I could return my preorder on amazon and just buy one from them...

They tell me prices charging 50% more for set boxes (which is meh, not great but theyre no amazon) but 100% more for collectors, $400! I want to support these guys, willing to spend more for the set, even though 50% more than amazon is a bit much, but once I heard the collector box price I said no, thats just a blatant rip off. 

This is the second time ive gone there and their prices have just become unreasonable. A month ago they doubled the prices of boosters I had bought only 3 weeks prior with no reason.

"The Sacred Five is a Commander-style format that is hopefully designed to create a fast-paced multiplayer game that doesn't drag on for eternity. The Sacred Five gives you 5 guaranteed cards that you can build a deck around before the game even starts. However, this comes with a steep cost, 15 life, and half your library. The Sacred Five removes some MtG mechanics that slow down or otherwise inhibit a quick game, like no Summoning Sickness and all creatures have flash! Check out the rules and tell me what you think.

1) The Sacred Five must include two basic lands, a non-basic land, a Creed, and a Commander 

2) The Sacred Five cards are in exile at the beginning of the game, and can only be cast during your turn. If these spells are destroyed, they are returned to exile, where they can be played again at no additional cost. They can be affected by abilities and spells that can reach exile.

3) A commander must be a creature, it does not have to be a legendary creature. The only exception to this rule is if the Commander is listed as a Planes Walker in the text, **then and only then** is a Planes Walker card permitted to be played.

4) A Creed is a set of beliefs that guide a Planes Walker's (a.k.a. the player) actions. A creed can only be an enchantment and excludes enchant other cards and Auras.\*

5) All creatures have Flash – play at anytime you could cast an instant and all creatures are not affected by Summoning Sickness. With the exception of the Commander.

6) The deck's size is fifty cards that include no duplicate non-basic land cards. The Sacred Five are excluded from the deck's size because they are a part of the Planes Walker, a.k.a. the player.

7) The Sacred Five and deck have no color requirements. 

8) In your first turn you may play one manna from your hand and one from exile

9) The starting and maximum hand size is ten cards.

10) Life totals start at twenty-five. 

11) If you gain twenty-five or more life over the course of the game you instantly lose the game, i.e. your life total can be no higher than forty-nine.

12) If a creature that has ""attacks each turn if able"" or ""attacks each combat if able"" comes into play during an opponent's turn or during\\after your own attack phase that creature comes into play attacking. 

*That's right, you can attack opponents during someone else's turn!*

*\*A Creed can be an artifact. This only applies to artifact decks that have artifact creatures as Commanders.* A Commander-style format I made up, because I was board during one of our weekly painfully slow multiplayer nights."
"I don’t know if this is just me being paranoid or if it’s an actual difference, but the cards seem better in this new set. Card stock is thicker, nice finish, no printing errors that I noticed.

"Midnight Hunt has come and with it, the VERY needed rotation. Eldraine had become a parasitic set, with overpowered cards and... you all heard it before (and probably played it if you play standard). 

(Just a warning&gt; english is not my native language, sorry in advance for any mistakes)

Now that rotation has come... Standard is a wasteland with some few hopes rising and shining. And in this metaphorical wasteland, my favorite deck has been decimated. My ""Mono-Black Merchant Devotion"" build lost almost everything except Shambling Ghast, Nullpriest of Oblivion, Agadeem's Awakeing and Lolth. The build was focused on Bo3, but as always, the side deck is dependant on the meta/worst match-ups. There's no point on focusing on it before having a deck to side.

TLDR: I want to get a better mono-black deck.

I've done some thinkering in the past few days and now I am with this build:

Main Deck

4 \[\[Ecstatic Awakener\]\] // Awoken Demon

4 \[\[Shambling Ghast\]\]

4 \[\[Novice Occultist\]\]

4 \[\[Nullpriest of Oblivion\]\]

2 \[\[Scourge of the Skyclaves\]\]

4 \[\[Tainted Adversary\]\]

2 I\[\[nscription of Ruin\]\]

4 \[\[Varragoth, Bloodsky Sire\]\]

4 \[\[Ebondeath, Dracolich\]\]

4 \[\[Lolth, Spider Queen\]\]

4 \[\[Agadeem's Awakeing\]\]

4 \[\[Hostile Hostel\]\]

16 Swamps

Side Deck: Removals and such. As I said before, I think the main focus now is to first find a build. BUT I wanna comment on \[\[Infernal Grasp\]\], the best 2-mana creature removal on Standard right now IMO. It won't make the main deck because I truly believe the deck has to have minimal dead draws on Game 1 against any deck, but I already have it on the side. \[\[Flunk\]\] will also be on the side, in case of the opponent running indestructable creatures.

Let's talk about the build, shall we?

Ecstatic Awakener - I think this is a pretty solid card for the build. For 1 mana on turn 1 and 3 mana on turn 3 you get a 4/4 ""with haste"" and a bonus if you sacrifice either Shambling Ghast or Novice occultist. It's crazy for a common. HOWEVER, it does have negatives that probably mean it will be cut after the next set or two. The main negative is that he is a 1/1 without any protection or extra abilities and the 4/4 has no evasion, protection or anything. I understand that this is because the card is a common, but I will be sad when this dude leaves the build. (also, side note: I don't think this should be a Wizard. He should be a Warlock. FLAVOUR FAIL, CARD CANCELED. WOTC IS GOING BANKRUPT AND MAGIC IS ENDING!)

Shambling Ghast &amp; Novice Occultist - The ""perfect"" sacrifices for anything in the deck. The Ghast either it takes out one chump-blocker or it makes a treasure and ramp you. The Novice Occultist is a new card that I believe will be a staple on standard mono-black if we find/get good and reliable sacrifice outlets. 

Tainted Adversary is a GREAT card. Probably my favorite from MID. Also, the whole Adversary cycle is cool. Tainted dude over here is great late game and, even on turn 5 it already is pretty good. Also, a 2/3 deathtouch body is nothing to laugh at.

Ebondeath is our finisher. A 5/2 flyer with virtually no other downsides outside his toughness. Lolth is our planeswalker. We don't have lots of options for drops 5+ and ~~Professor Onyx~~ Llilliana is better on a magecraft build. Lolth create blockers with her -3, gets loyalty when creatures die (ideally, what we will be doing all the time during the game) and draw us cards. her ultimate is pretty dope but unrealistic to trigger every game.

Agadeem's Awakening is a revival spell with a land attached. Good for consistency. Hostile Hostel is, sadly, our only consistent sacrifice outlet right now and it isn't THAT good at it. HOWEVER it can, if you are lucky, become a 3/7 that deals extra damage while attacking by banishing creature cards from your graveyard while also having good protection by Phasing Out for 4 mana. It has its problems (like taking time to deal lots of damage as the Creeping Inn), but is good enough imo.

Nullpriest of Oblivion, Scourge of the Skyclaves, Inscription of Ruin and Varragoth are here to fill space but I will talk a little about them: Nullpriest is pretty cool being a revival spell with a 2/1 menace and lifelink body, but without Merchant it doesn't seem have lots of good targets on Mono-Black right now. Scourge is a pet card of mine that I know is going away, and it just isn't that good, sadly. Inscription of Ruin and Varragoth are filler cards and, while I CAN see Varragoth staying until we get better cards, I am sure someone will help me find a replacement for the Inscription.

So... yeah. I want to perfect this build. Not necessarily make it a meta-deck (I doubt it will), but at least make it competitive enough so I can get mythic on Arena. Specifically I am looking for: Sacrifice Outlets, good sacrifices and by good better Drop-3s. BUT, I am also looking for a good mono-black ""good stuff"" deck for Bo3, even if it means a completely different approach and strategy.

Thanks for reading! Help me build a Mono Black post-rotation!"
"It’s as the title says, I’m looking for out of the box ways to win that are focused around [[Gisela, blade of goldnight]] I’m already running heartless hidetsugu, grafted exoskeleton and jeska, thrice reborn is there any other cards that have a similar effect? Win cons focused around gisela"
"In an attempt to get out ahead of the numerous ""I opened up an old card from a Midnight Hunt pack, is my LGS scamming me?"" posts that we see with every set release, here's a refresher on ""The List:""

If you're confused about why you found a non-Midnight Hunt card in a pack, congrats - you've found a ""List"" card! The List is a collection of 300 cards from across the history of Magic that randomly appear in Set boosters. They can be identified by the small planeswalker icon in the bottom left corner. Every Set Booster pack has a 1 in 4 chance of containing a List card instead of an ad card.

The List is updated with each Standard set - the Midnight Hunt List can be found here:

[

So if you've opened up an older or unusual card from a Set Booster, no, your LGS is not trying to scam you with resealed packs - you just got lucky. Enjoy the pulls! It's that time again! Yes, it is normal that you opened a non-Midnight Hunt card from a Set Booster pack - it's from ""The List!"""

"I've been thinking about it recently, and it seems like it's something that I personally would like for wotc to tackle. 

Millions of products are shipped and sold globaly. From secret lairs, to crates full of booster boxes, it's a lot of product. However, two issues stem from this, in my opinion.

The first one is the problem of unsold product. Not everything sells, and useless product gets repackaged and sent off elsewhere, or dumped like garbage. This seems like a pretty big problem, considering my following point.

The second one, is the actual packaging and material used for the production of these products. This is closely related to the first point, as wotc has been employing some pretty wasteful packaging (see secret lairs, commander product, etc.). Booster packs are cracked daily and the unusable wrappers are thrown away into the trash, just as draft chaff is. Both cannot be reused due to the materials that they are made out of. Superdrops contain such a number of excess plastic and boxes, it's crazy.

Personally, I wish that wotc actually stepped forward with their opinion regarding these issues, as sustainability is a very common topic. The japanese printers utilize recyclable materials in the production of cards, which seems like a great step forward.

To conclude this post, I want to say that this is just my 2 cents. I might not be right in everything and I don't mean to start a war, I simply want to know this sub's opinion on this. Also, I am well aware that if wotc made mtg more ecological, then it wouldn't completely solve all ecological issues. What do you think about the ecological impact of mtg/wotc?"

I learned to play it myself in 2019 (although I had been collecting the cards themselves since SOI). We've both been having a blast playing together and I'm genuinely surprised that she's so into it. There have been several times where she was the one who was asking to play (*shocker*). I'm obviously way more involved in the franchise than she is (I'm into the lore and I have a much more advanced understanding of the game than she does), but overall she's been super into it. We've mostly been playing some precons (planeswalker decks, starter kits, and commander decks, primarily), but I've also made some decks of my own for both of us to try out (she kicked my ass with a white/red Magda treasures deck). I still have to guide her through basic concepts each game, but she understands it enough to at least be able to play on a *very* basic level with a little bit of hand-holding.

"As a fairly new player/collector (since Kaldheim) I wanted to have a treasure hunt. Just finished sorting by type and here's the approximate breakdown:
500 creatures (including artifact creatures)
200 instants
100 enchantments 
100 sorceries
50 basic lands
25 special lands 
25 artifacts (mana, equipment and vehicles)

Included in that are the 50ish rares and foils. 

So far I've seen some really playable stuff. I had acquired probably 5000 cards or so before this box and I only got maybe 10 I already have. As far as duplicates they were minimal (4 copies of 1, 3 copies of 2, 2 copies of like 5).

**Gruul Wolves:** One of the most aggressive tribal decks I've played in a while. The day/night mechanic is devastating to control players who pass turn, but aggro can easily double spell to revert to day (I'm anticipating more aggro than control). This deck has more interaction with 4x Blizzard Brawl and Frost Bite, but keeping Arlinn alive against aggro can be tough. Primal Adversary is solid, but can be awkward to cast, as you need to leave enough lands untapped to attack with them. I haven't had time to really work out the sideboard, but Toralf + Blizzard Brawl has always performed well for me.

"Ravnica is an explicitly urban plane composed of nested layers of megalithic masonry. And it is awesome.

Innistrad and Llorwyn are explicitly rural planes made up of vast stretches of wilderness broken up by agrarian communities, and they are alternately ominous &amp; wholesome. 

...What would a suburban plane look like? 

I realize it's a very anachronistic thing to put in a fantasy game but it occurred to me that the kind of terrain that a huge portion of the playerbase are most familiar with basically \*never\* comes up in fictional settings- even in the loosest, most allegorical sense. 

Which is a shame, because fantasy's supposed to hold up a funhouse mirror to every day reality. 

You can't tell me that there's no entertainment value to be mined out of that weird hinterland between the actual city proper and the open wilderness. Where domiciles are stacked up like loosely fitted bricks, with just enough wiggle room for nature proper to wriggle its way in through the cracks.

"Hello everyone. I have a question about Purple Worm and why it's a Worm and not a Wurm. 

Got this great deck which I call ""Wurm Reanimator"". You can see [a link of a screen shot of the deck with an image of Purple Worm above the deck.]( 

WHY do you ask, can't Purple Worm join in on the fun with his Wurm pals? It's because he was created and labeled with the creature type 'Worm', which apparently there are only [9 magic cards through out the games history which have this creature typing](

On the other hand, 'Wurm' has [94 cards that are associated with that creature type]( 

This means that when using Haunting Voyage, the most efficient creature type for this concept is Wurm. So instead, I brought a Tarrasque, because why not. 

Question stands, shouldn't the creature type for Purple Worm be Wurm????

"Hi everybody!

I have questions. If anybody has the time and knowledge to hit me with some answers, I would be sincerely appreciative.

I've been doing a lot of googling and reading about the differences between traditional foiling and etched foiling when it comes to MtG cards. I've gained a pretty comprehensive understanding of the process by which each type is actually printed lol, but there are still a couple of things that I'm not entirely clear on.

According to my resources, the primary difference between traditional foils and etched foils is that traditional uses a layer of foil laminate, while etched is made with metallic paint instead. They say that the biggest benefit to etched foil cards is that they won't curl the way traditional foils will (I know all about why curling occurs now too lol). As far as appearance goes, traditional foils will be a kind of rainbow shiny all over, while etched foils will be more of a sparkly shiny and only on particular sections of the card. It was also stated that ""if a foil card has a little star next to the collectors number in the bottom left, it's an etched foil.""

So that's all great. In theory, all of this makes sense to me. But in practice, things starts to get a little less transparent. For context, I've been opening a bunch of Japanese Strixhaven set boosters. From those boosters, I've pulled a fair handful of foil cards (1 per pack, obviously). All of those foil cards have a little star in the bottom left. So I'm to presume that they're all etched foil. 

However, a good 90% of those ""etched foils"" have been curled af straight out the pack. So clearly, at least one source for my research is giving me some bad Intel. And therein lies the question. 

One of these following statements is some bullshit:

- Etched foil cards will not curl like traditional foils do.
- All foil cards with a star in the bottom left corner are etched foils.

I'm hoping somebody here can potentially tell me which one it is. If you've gotten this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read through. And I'm looking forward to getting your input!

"Hey everybody, 

I haven’t played standard in a while and I’m thinking about getting back into it. I notice that with MID there are going to be more double faced card than ever. 

When using the placeholder tokens, obviously you’re going to write the name of the front and back of the card on top. But, in that big space in the middle of the card, can I put notes about what the card does? (Assume that this would be for a big tournament, not just kitchen table or FNM)

For example, lets use [[Jwari Disruption]] and [[Malevolent Hermit]]

For Jwari Disruption in the big box could I write “Force Spike” then have a big line and write “CiP tapped Island”? (Even though it isn’t, technically island)

For Malevolent Hermit could I write “Cursecatcher” on top and then a line and something like “2/2 flyer” on the bottom? Both aren’t really accurate, but I’ll know what I mean. 

Similar, but not quite the same question; Could I keep Malevolent Hermit in my deck without the placeholder card (perfectly opaque sleeve) and have a print out of [[Benevolent Geist]] (not a real card, say a high-quality photocopy) and just overlay it when he flips?

"I love the investigate mechanic from Innistrad.  (""Midnight Hunt"" is my first time playing with it but I know it was introduced in ""Shadows over Innistrad"").

It is such a flavorful way to get card draw, and feels like an especially appropriate way for White to get card draw.  (Law and Order, investigations; they just go hand in hand.)

This got me thinking.  When we next return to Ravnica, the Boros Legion should get ""Investigate!""

The Boros Legion needs more card draw.  A lot of people splash an extra color just to bring card draw to the deck.  Investigate would bring card draw, but in a delayed form and at a price of 2 mana, which development already deems appropriate on white.

The flavor on that is perfect.  The Boros Legion enforces the laws.  Some of their members are tasked with going out and investigating crimes, just like Argus Kor did.

Creating some red/white Boros cards with Investigate would be a perfect marriage of flavor and function.

And creating some mono white investigators, is perfect because they could be used by either the Boros Legion or the Azorius Senate, as both enforce laws and investigate, and even Orzhov Syndicate could make use of them flavor wise as they too are involved in enforcing order.  Although their enforces are more about investigating subversion against the guild and its interests. When we next visit Ravnica the Boros Legion should get Investigate!"

He was supposed to teach me before he passed. Thanks. (Sorry if this isn't allowed. I wasn't sure who else to ask.) Husband passed away - what do I do with his old decks?"
I recently saw a trailer for the new Magic TCG innistrad and wanted to get into collecting and playing the game. I see that there are multiple different types of booster boxes and I also see something called command packs. Can anyone explain to me the difference of all these different packs? Noob question. What are the differences between set and draft boosters?

"Hello,

I've been playing for about 2-3 months and so far have been exclusively buying the bundles for sets I got interested in (D&amp;D and Kaldheim) for around £35. I'm super excited for Midnight Hunt and wanted to get a larger spread of these cards to play with, since WoTC have dropped the bundle sized down to only 8 packs I was considering diving into my first booster or draft box. They are similar in price at the moment. 

Which do you all believe is better value for cards and deckbuilding for casual MtG?

Thank you! Looking to buy either my first booster box or first draft box for MH and need advice."
"Hi there!

I have two questions concerning [[Anowon, the Ruin Thief]] and [[Spark Double]].

---

1) Let's assume it's a 1on1-situation in Commander: When I have Anowon out and copy it with Spark Double, does the whole ""my opponent mills 1 card for each 1 damage my rogues deal""-spiel work twice for each rogue?

Example: I have two 1/1 Faerie Rogue Tokens with flying, which have 2x+1/+1 (for each Anowon, respectively), so they are 3/3.Both of those tokens deal 3 damage each, resulting in 6 damage total. Meaning -&gt; 6 cards are being milled (triggered by original Anowon). Shortly after that on the stack, 6 cards are being milled (triggered by the copied Anowon).

I believe it works like this, since they are both triggered abilities which work seperately (one trigger for each Anowon). I just wanted to make sure :)

---

2) Higher difficulty question: I know that if I attack seperate players with rogues while Anowon is under my control, I'm able to draw a card if one of those sperate players mill a creature card. Meaning: I attack players Andy, Ben and Chloe with two 3/3 Faerie Rogue Tokens with flying. Each player doesn't block, so 6 damage is dealt to Andy, Ben and Chloe. Andy and Ben both mill 6 cards which include at least one creature card, so I draw two cards for that. Chloe just milled 6 cards, containing only lands, so I draw no card for that player.

Let's assume I have an original Anowon + a copy (like the situation mentioned in question 1) in play. How would the situation with players Andy, Ben and Chloe work out, now? They would mill 2x6 cards, I assume (since original Anowon and its copy's triggered abilites trigger both), meaning I potentially have the chance to draw a maximum of 2 cards per player, if they mill at least one creature in original-trigger-mill and copy-trigger-mill?

---

Tough ones. I hope (know &lt;3) you can help me!

Thanks in advance. Anowon, the Ruin Thief and Spark Double (copying it)"
Does anybody have a recommendation for an LGS in the Irvine area to play commander at? My girlfriend and I just moved in the area and our previous store was great because the owner was interactive with players and his wife and sister worked there which helped cull any fears of creeps for my girlfriend. It would be nice to find another store thats similar in its friendliness and lack of tolerance for creeps and condescending misogynists. Looking for LGS in Irvine Area
"I tried asking MaRo this question, but to no avail, so I'm turning to the internet majority.

Has it ever been said anywhere that generally speaking, every Phyrexian can be expected to have glistening oil in its body? Does it get 'burned out' of them when they use the new planar portal?

I ask because I'm just always kind of kermitfaced whenever we see a Praetor show up on a new plane, because if Karn showing up on Mirrodin with literally one iota of glistening pol, even unintentionally, meant the plane was inevitably doomed. And now we've got Vorinclex going to Kaldheim and presumably Jin-Gitaxis going to Kamigawa, which is going to be even more rife with technology, so is it safe to assume that both of those planes can just be assumed to be dead via assimilation too?

I really would prefer to hope not, because it just basically means no matter what a phyrexian does or how hard you fight it, any plane they just STEP FOOT on is automatically a dead loss these days. And I'd really rather not just auto-lose Kamigawa now because Jin decided to visit it, regardless of what he does there. Glistening Oil and Infection"
"Pretty much per title. I'm tempted to preorder Midnight Hunt from Amazon, but they're quoting delivery for 29th September, which is nearly a week after release.

I appreciate that they can't put the product into players' hands until the street date, but five days after seems excessive. Especially considering their prime delivery etc.

Has anyone previously preordered with Amazon? Is the estimated delivery accurate? Anyone had much experience preordering a new set from Amazon?"

"I am sorting through a collection of Jumpstart cards and am curious if I can reconstruct the original packets. Is there a way to identify which packet a card belongs to? E.g., for Historic Jumpstart WotC posted the decklists:

"I’ve always enjoyed cooperative boardgames, so I wrote up a game variant similar to [horde magic]( with goals in mind similar to EDH league points.

The object of the game is that zombies are slowly coming in and attacking randomly, and if all the surviving players can’t finish a goal of their own in time, the horde grows and bigger threats appear eventually.

I used [EDH REC’s theme page]( as a way of being as inclusive to as many popular deck strategies as possible, given the way to win is reaching a goal first. If players win or lose without everyond having finished a goal, they “restart the game” but for just them, similar to how [Lich’s Mirror]( works (updated with infect and commander damage in mind).

The intent here is to play a game that focuses on everyone playing to win together instead of it being winner-take-all. I hope you folks enjoy.

**NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD**

*Hoarde Tactics* — Zombie Horde creatures have ""This creature can't block"" and ""At the beginning of combat on your turn, choose an opponent at random. This creature attacks that player this combat if able.""

*Endless Ranks* — At the beginning of each turn, that player creates a 2/2 black Zombie Horde creature token. If there are 10 or more Zombie Horde creature tokens on the battlefield, instead create a 4/4 black Zombie Horde creature token with ""When this creature dies, create two 2/2 black Zombie Horde creature tokens.""

*The Lich* — At the beginning of each turn, if there are 20 or more Zombie Horde creature tokens on the battlefield, create Horde Lich, a legendary 1/1 blue Zombie Wizard creature with hexproof and ""Zombie Horde creatures have menace and 'When this creature dies, you lose 1 life.' ""

**ENDLESS NIGHT**

If a player would win the game, instead that player shuffles all cards from all zones they own into their library, draws seven cards, and their life total becomes their starting life total. Remove all commander damage and counters from that player. End the turn.

If a player would lose the game and their starting life total wasn't 0, instead that player shuffles all cards from all zones they own into their library, draws seven cards, and their life total becomes half their starting life total rounded down. Remove all commander damage and counters from that player. End the turn.

**DAWN AT LAST**

When each player has reached a goal, each player wins the game.

**RESUPPLY**

At the beginning of each turn, if that player had completed a goal during their last turn, each other player creates a treasure, food, and clue for each goal they've completed this game.

"It's spooky season folx! It's that time of year for ~~Throne of Eldraine to Rotate~~ Innistrad: Midnight Hunt Prerelease Weekend! If you haven't been through this with us at r/magictcg before, here's how this weekend will work:

We know that a lot of y'all will be playing events, picking up kits this weekend to play at home or with your playgroups, and/or picking up early product. You're going to want advice before you play (maybe it's your first ever prerelease), you'll want to share cool stories, talk about what cards you pulled/played, how you went 0-3 but had one game win with [[Triskaidekaphile]], etc.

With over 480,000 users subscribed to this subreddit, (and y'all lurking who aren't subscribed) it's easier for everyone to keep all pre-release Midnight Hunt content in one place instead hundreds of individual posts... Enter the Condensed Prerelease Megathread!

That means absolutely anything you want to ask, discuss, tell stories about, or show off regarding Innistrad: Midnight Hunt prerelease needs to go in this thread and only this thread! Individual posts *will* be deleted. 

Prerelease weekends are honestly some of the most exciting times of the year for Magic players and we want to hear ALL about it!

**Also: do not offer or ask for Arena codes here.** We allowed it once and itresulted in a thread that was useless. Codes get claimed immediately, all the comments were disappointed people spamming ""Anyone got another code?"" It's just not a fun time. We'd like people to actually be able to discuss their prerelease experiences without having to wade through a thousand comments worth of that, so we will not be allowing people to transact Arena codes here. Innistrad: Midnight Hunt - Prerelease Weekend Condensed Megathread! #MTGMidnight"
"I was looking at the set release and noticed something that may be a complete coincidence. There is a set of 5 uncommons that are STRICTLY better than previously printed common counterparts. The reason I emphasize strictly better is because people throw around the term “strictly” better frequently when it is not actually accurate, in this case it is. 

In white:
[[Ritual of hope]] is strictly better than [[Glorious Charge]]
[[Loyal Gryff]] is strictly better than [[Dawn Gryff]]
There may be two for white because one just happened to go to print by coincidence alongside this cycle, or because it isn’t a cycle at all and this is all just baseless conjecture

In blue:
[[Fading Hope]] is strictly better than [[Unsommon]]

In black:
[[Foul play]] is strictly better than [[Defeat]]

In red:
[[Play with fire]] is strictly better than [[Shock]]

And in green:
[[Brood Weaver]] is strictly better than [[Giant Spider]] Is there a secret cycle of uncommons in Innistrad:Midnight Hunt?"
"In a plane flavored around mono color being the emphasis, would remphasize alot of the normal associations for each color or reinvent their identities a bit? What would that world look like? Would you have a race or class to each color? Would there be any specific mechanics or specifics on how a draft emphasizing mono color decks would work  you think would be in those sets and would that influence the lore in your mind? What would cultures influenced by such a strong color divide look like?

Out of general curiosity, how you build a plane completely dedicated to separating and expanding on each of the 5 colors? If you were to make a plane designed to be returned to for mono color based sets, how you design the plane?"

" I’ve always been a huge fan of Guild Wars, and a few years ago I found out that the skill system was actually inspired by Magic the Gathering!

Mike O’Brien: We looked around for role playing games that weren’t all about numbers going up. In our search, we were inspired by Magic: the Gathering. In Magic, the more you play, the more abilities you acquire, but that doesn’t make you strictly more powerful than other players. You pick and choose abilities from your collection, and your choices determine how well you do.

This is exactly the feeling when playing Guild Wars. You collect skills (there’s around 2000 of them) but you can only use up to 8 at a time, therefore creating a need to strategize to make a good build. For me, this created an RPG that’s very different from what was out there.

After many many years, I became a game designer and started working on an idea for a RPG game. Then that idea actually became a card game aiming to replicate that experience of playing an online RPG. In order to give that “real time” combat feel I’ve designed Ambal Tournament with simultaneous rounds, and even during the battle phase players select their cards at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;



So it felt like a full circle moment when I realized that Guild Wars, which is inspired by a card game, inspired me to create a card game! Even though my game plays drastically differently than Magic, many MtG players really enjoyed it. 

It’s really cool to see how inspirations flow between tabletop and digital games. Magic inspired GW, which inspired Ambal"
"My friend Jim has been playing and collecting magic cards on and off for a few years now. Recently me and a few other people who are brand new to magic started going to Jim’s house to play CMDR. Everyone except Jim bought a precon deck to play but Jim built his own. After losing Jim would throw out remarks calling our decks “pay to win”. Saying that the cards in the deck were too strong. He also said that we were not using our own strategy to win. So after me and Jim lost to my friends precon deck he said that precons where banned. We can only play by making our own decks.

The thing is I get where he is coming from with “not using our own strategies to win” but to call it pay to win is insane to me especially the much stronger cards out there. Anything I can say to convince him? My friend says CMDR precons are banned in his house"

"Hi everyone!

What's the best option for **sleeving collections in side loading zipped binder for long term storage (collection, no playing).** 

1. Double-Sleeved with KMC perfect fit + Dragon Shield classic as outer sleeve.
2. Only KMC perfect fit 
3. Only Outer Sleeve

I've read that multiple people says that perfect fit could damage borders and that with outer sleeve is enough. However, other people say that with outer sleeve the card floates around the sleeves and that's also dangerous. What's the best choice?

Thank you!! Help with sleeving collection in side loading binder for long term storage"
"I'm looking for a storage solution. My decks are all in Ultra-Pro flimsy plastic boxes (the Eclipse for commander decks) because my cards basically never leave my house and I'm cheap. I've got most of those boxes in empty fat pack boxes, but that only fits 2 commander decks or 3 regular ones. Does anyone have any storage solutions for this? Do the ultra pro boxes fit in the cubes of the Stanley tool box? I've seen most of the Prof's videos on the subject, and have yet to see anything specifically like this. Box for storing deckboxes"
"I was thinking of adapting the duels format to mtg, I really like the concept of duels but I think it was horribly implemented into hs, basically my concept is you would draft a powerful passive and then draft a deck from the cube. 

Some passives I've considered:
At the beginning of your upkeep make a 2/2 token with all creature types

If a creature entering the battlefield would cause an ability to trigger that ability triggers an additional time

If a non land permanent would add a mana to your mana pool it adds another of that kind to your mana pool. 

Etc etc

Also not too worried about wording just yet 

Has anyone else done something similar? HS duels cube?"
"Probably not a hot take. But I missed Innistrad the first couple times around so this is my chance to gush. 
I played in grade school for a couple years around Onslaught. I remember just staring at the cards for hours in my binder. The art was so dark, intense and mysterious. I felt like I was getting away with something by owning magic cards as a kid. Went to catholic school and was already feeling like I wanted to break out of that way of thinking, and magic opened my eyes to things that were just weird and different and cool. My grandma would get me a pack here and there and I remember opening a Phage the Untouchable and being like I cant believe my grandma got me this lol.

Got back into the game during the pandemic, and this Innistrad set gives me the same feeling I had as a kid. The mechanics, story and art all work together in such a way that I get goosebumps reading through the previews. The art on cards like Unnatural Moonrise and Mask of Griselbrand do it for me. 

The set takes itself seriously, but splashes in impish humor about setting things on fire etc. Cant get enough, and it gives me hope that the design team can churn out real bangers when they want to. I was worried about the fortnite crossovers and all that, but if we can get at least one set like Innistrad each year ill still be a pretty happy camper. The Innistrad art and flavor reminds me why I love Magic."
"I’ve only gotten into magic very recently but am loving it, I tend to lean towards red and white decks (my friend has some pre-made) but I’m going to make my own soon.

"I first noticed it with the art for Lathril, and now again with Leinore, but WotC seems to have been pretty consistently using better quality art for the box (which most people throw out) than for the commander cards themselves. I mean, the regular art for Leinore is fine, but an extended art version of the art on the box? Gorgeous.   


Does anyone know the reasoning behind that? Why Do Commander Deck Boxes Get Better Art Than the Cards?"
"I was wondering what would happen if you play Animate Land on any of the guildgates, then copy that gate with Sakashima the Imposter. Does Sakashima become a gate that is not animated?

I'm trying to figure out what cards to use for a fun white/black constructed deck for Modern. I'm already done with lands but I have to narrow all other cards down from 76 different ones. Obviously I shouldn't have all unique cards, but it's possible to get multiple of the same card. I don't have an infinite budget though so having something like 4x Exquisite Blood, as fun as that sounds, won't be possible.

Thanks in advance and apologies for not being very experienced. These are the cards that looked the most fun to me.

"I have recently been looking in to fire/burglary safes to store valuable cards in. A sales rep told me that most safes do not protect from flooding.

Does anyone have suggestions for a product I could buy for waterproofing, which could fit inside of a medium sized safe? I feel like I'm likely not the only person to have had this problem when it comes to storing valuable magic cards. Suggestions for waterproof storage to protect valuable cards?"
"This is unlikely going to ever get changed, but does it bother anyone else that a clone of a legendary creature ""triggers"" the legendary rule? 

So, the original legendary rule was intended to reflect the fact that while there are a bunch of [[scathe zombies]] out there that you can summon, there is only one [[Barktooth Warbeard]]. If there is only one of him, how could there possibly be two of him in play? Now, the rules have since changed to make the play experience better, so now, Barktooth Warbeard could very well end up fighting himself, but the flavor remains more or less the same, there is only one of him, so you can only have one of him in play.

But clones are just shapeshifters that take the appearance of the creatures they copy. A clone of [[Johan]] (should have picked him from the start, much shorter name) is not Johan. Why would a shapeshifter taking the appearance of Johan cause either itself, or Johan to dissipate in a puff of legendary-rule smoke?

And before you say ""well, legendary is a downside, it's for balance purposes, copying a legendary creature would be too strong!"", this just doesn't hold to scrutiny. First off, is copying [[Isamaru]] with a clone really too strong? Why is that unfair, but I can copy [[Primeval titan]] or [[Serra's Emissary]] without any issue? Moreover, there are some clones/copy effects that can copy legendary creatures without issues (e.g., [[spark double]]) and they didn't break anything. 

You could say it takes a special kind of clone to be able to copy the grandeur that is a legendary creature, but that doesn't hold either, because you can actually decide that you keep the clone and let Johan go. What's the flavor behind that? After all, when [[dack's duplicate]] turn into [[Grenzo, Dungeon Warden]], did Grenzo vanish from existence? 

""It's the rules, the rules would just be too messy"". Would they? Would the rules break apart if ""Legendary"" wasn't a copyable value?

So if there are no gameplay, rules or flavor reasons, why can't Johan and Johan's clone fight hand in hand to take down [[Axelrod Gunnarson]]? After all, if the galactic republic managed to create an entire army by cloning the legendary Jango Fett, I feel like I should be able to build my own clone army of [[Chevill]]? I mean, I guess I can, as long as they're wearing a [helm](Helm of the Host)... oh... Clones/copy effect and legendary creatures"

"So just wondering, back when I first started playing MTG between Tempest and Stronghold, I opened 5 boxes of Tempest because I really wanted Cursed Scroll.  5 boxes opened and 0 Cursed Scrolls.  Now I know I could have just been unlucky but over the years I've seen this every so often.  Good example was this past release of Forgotten Realms.  I purchased a case and three collector's boxes and got 0 Tiamat cards.  I regularly open a case of cards each release and there are normally a few cards that I will get just one of but I've never opened a case before and not gotten at least one of every mythic not to mention opening three collector's boosters as well.  


So just wondering, has anyone else come across this and think possibly there might be Ultra cards or was I just incredibly unlucky? Are Ultra Rares and Ultra Mythics a thing?"

"So we know about the long nights and shorter days, and how that's making it hard for the humans. We know that Avacyn is gone and Sigarda is trying to fill her role. We know that the Dire Strain is making the Werewolves more powerful.

"I've read the release notes, but there still seems to be confusion as to how the day/night flips durning a 2HG game. Originally I read it as both heads would have to blank their turn (a huge downside.) 

However this rule has thrown that into question:

805.9. Any ability that refers to the “active player” refers to one specific active player, not to all of the active players. The ability’s controller chooses which one the ability refers to at the time its effect is applied.

I own a HASCON Sword of Dungeons and Dragons playmat; I'm trying to find out information on it regarding the price of it as I'm trying to get values on all my collectibles! Unfortunately, TCGPlayer is one of only two places I've seen it but it has no sales listings, and the only other was a single online store and it had it for sale $50 but has been out of stock pretty much since HASCON itself.

Is this mat really that rare or am I searching wrong?

Any advice would be appreciated :)

"Hey there,

I'm brand new at this (Magic, though pretty new at Reddit too) and am looking for recommendations for how you manage your card collections.  I got into Magic because of the D&amp;D mash up of AFR, and my 9 year old asked about it (he LOVES Magic now). At the moment, I'm just sticking with AFR, so my collection is small and focused, but I'd love a way to compare what I have with what's available in the set, to consider buying a few extra cards I might have missed to make fun combos and the like.

What do you use?  Why do you like it?  I couldn't find any other threads here on this (see above comment about being new here, however...) but feel free to recommend other reads if you don't mind.  Thanks! Recommended card managers"

"Trick or treat everyone! The harvest festival awaits and the dark forces of Innistrad are looming in the ever-increasing night. While this set may be Werewolves time to shine, there might be a few treats for the Cows.

This is the first time I’ve played with an Innistrad set, and I’m not too much of a horror fan, but I’ve been pretty impressed so far.

As always, this review is targeted at identifying cards that have the potential to be useful in a Minotaur based deck. Most of what I say is largely targeted toward Pioneer, as that is the best format to play Minotaurs in my opinion, but is by no means limited to that format. 


Before we get into the review proper, I want to take a moment for a side talking point.

[Fleshtaker]( Hey guys we have our first Minotaur cosplayer! I really have to give credit to the costume work, that head looks real AF. But seriously I so wished this could have been a minotaur. I believe that the cards effect could have been Red/Black (see [Slaughter-Priest of Mogis]( and they are ones Minotaur tribal could use.

**Black:**

- [Infernal Grasp]( Welcome back to another round of 2 mana black kill spell with a condition/downside. If you have been using Feed the Swarm, consider replacing them with this, unless you needed the enchantment removal in your metas.

- [Mask of Griselbrand]( hmmmmmm. This is tough. Flying and life link are keywords that Minotaurs currently lack, and having a mini griselbrand ability is really good to get some gas. However, the three mana costs make this hard to include.

**Red:**

- [Cathartic Pyre]( This is a bit of a meta call. Normally I would run Abrade, but if you don’t face a lot of problematic artifacts then this pairs well with the discard themes Minotaurs have cut-out for themselves.

- [Falkenrath Pit Fighter]( I really wish this was a minotaur or didn’t specifically care about Vampires. I think even as it is, this is bordering playable in minotaur decks. It’s a red 1 drop with 2 power and it has a conditional thrill of Possibility attached to it. Given how aggressive minotaur decks are already, this should be easy to activate when needed and greatly improves our early game.

- [Moonveil Regent]( Hello there! This dragon I am very interested in and impressed by. Essentially it allows us to immediately become heckbent if we cast a mono colored spell which is important for Neheb the Worthy and all our discard synergies. Being a 4 drop flyer is also good for the minotaur curve as there aren’t many worth while Minotaurs for 4 mana.

- [Play With Fire]( If you were already running Shock or Wild Slash I think this easily replaces it as being strictly better.

- [Raze the Effigy]( Like with Cathartic Pyre, this is a bit of a meta call. It costs 1 less than abrade, but doesn’t remove creatures, but it could make your creatures bigger in a tight combat round. I won’t deny that it is enticing.


**Multicolored:**

- [Florian, Volderan Scion]( This vampire feels more suited for commander, as it seems like a win more in normal constructed matches. That said if we hit our opponent enough, we could find a card that would close the game. But being a vampire and a three drop makes this very difficult to include in most lists.

- [Rem Karolus, Stalwart Slayer]( This seems like it has potential in [Firesong and Sunspeaker](): commander decks. Rem’s ability to increase spell damage is very useful considering the deck runs a lot of damage dealing spells.

**Colorless:**

- [Moonsilver Key]( I see this as a commander card to either fix mana or to find artifacts like sol ring or thran dynamo. This is big, because red/black struggles with keeping pace when ramping in Commander. Or if you want to be spicy, fetch out Strixhaven Stadium to put the game on a clock.

- [Pithing Needle]( This card doesn’t need too much explanation, being able to shut down planeswalkers or other problem permanents is huge for 1 mana. Definitely include in your sideboards.

**Lands:**

- [Haunted Ridge]( I’m always happy to see more red/black dual lands. This is obviously worse than the fast lands of Kaladesh/Scars of Mirrodin, in that you need at least 3 lands for this to come untapped. However, for Pioneer or Commander, if your running fabled passage, then I think you should be fine with running this.

**Closing:**

So that was not as terrible as I thought it would be. I was sure that innistrad would bring a bit of a dry spell for Minotaur offerings. If Crimson Vow is anything like this then I will be a little more interested. 
Personally I’m hoping that we get some Minotaur Gansters in New Capena, and I feel confident that some will show up in the two Dominaria focused sets next year.

"I'm going to my first prerelease in store since Theros Beyond Death! So it's been a while to say the least and some changes have been made. Before I reach out and look like a nob at my LGS, who've mentioned that they use the companion app to register and play tournaments now, I wanted to know (and I googled this trust me) if the app needs data to function for joining events. My phone doesn't have it and if there's no wifi, I may be in a bit of a lurch. Thanks and happy gaming if you're at prerelease too this weekend! Question about the companion app"
"So I'm debating to go into tomorrow's Pre-release at my local LGS, but the problem is I don't yet speak very well the language of ""this"" country.

In one hand I'd looooooooove to play MTG after so many years but I don't want to go there and be annoying to everyone asking what that card does in English (assuming they speak it) and obviously I'm not a good player either.

I've been thinking about using scryfall on my phone but I feel that will make everything very slow, what do you guys think, should I sit this one out? Going to a pre-release whose language I don't understand?"
"There is usually a WotC article named ""The Tokens of (Set)"" that comes out way before the set and shows the tokens and their art. Did I miss it this time? Anyone heard anything of it? Tokens of Midnight Hunt?"
"I recently had a conversation with someone at my LGS about ways we thought that the rules worked when we started learning the game outside of an environment where someone actually knew how the rules worked on anything but the most basic level, and I found it really interesting to see how strongly people can misunderstand the rules.

For me it was back in Takir I had the silumgar precon that centered around the exploit mechanic. For anyone who (understandably) doesn't know what the mechanic does, it lets you sacrifice a creature as the creature with exploit enters the battlefield and gives you an effect if you do like [[Sidisi's Faithful]]. 
The way I and everyone of my friends misunderstood was that we thought that sacrifice meant the same thing as destroy. Which in a meta heavly centered around big creatures was absolutely broken.

I would really be interested in your storys if you had something similar happen when you started the game.

I also want to make sure to say that I don't want to make fun of people new to the game with this post. It is very understandable to misunderstand the rules especially if you are playing non English cards. Things that happen when you learn the game outside of a LGS."
"Some Pauper players first discovered this bug when activating \[\[Wellwisher\]\] and spells like \[\[Peach Garden Oath\]\]. MTGO will resolve the spell but maintain that spell on the stack. When both players pass again, the spell resolves again, the spell stays on the stack, and so on. This results in MTGO resolving the same spell over and over, and also prevents the stack from clearing. With the stack unable to clear, a turn can't advance, and thus can result in a soft lock.

 We have found this bug to apply to effects that:  
\-counts objects,  
\-gains life based on the number of those objects. (stole this formatting from Spokes)

Examples include \[\[Kraul Foragers\]\] and \[\[Crypt Incursion\]\], and the most abusable of them are \[\[Glimmerpost\]\], \[\[Peach Garden Oath\]\], and \[\[Take Heart\]\]. In the case of Take Heart, since it pumps a creature, you can grow the target of Take Heart to Infinite/Infinite, and then just \[\[Fling\]\] it for a trivial win. The bug occurs even if the count is 0, so you can do the Take Heart exploit without attacking.

We have so far not found any other effects with this problem (e.g. Spellstutter Sprite and Gray Merchant of Asphodel work fine; Battalion triggers also work fine. Smitten Swordmaster works fine, oddly enough.)

This bug will compromise MTGO tournament play if not addressed, with Take Heart being available in every non-Standard format. For abilities, the loop can be ended through auto-yielding the first time it happens, but in the case of spells, the bug is not avoidable through intentional player action, and so we cannot simply ask players not to exploit the bug. Temporary bans would need to address every single possible problem card, including other effects that have yet to be found. WotC has already banned Glimmerpost and Champion of Dusk, so it is clear that they are aware of the issue, but this is not enough. The only viable solution I see is for WotC to urgently fix the bug, and to suspend \*all\* tournament play on MTGO until it is fixed.  


Spokes made a video demonstrating the bug and has posted it on r/pauper. here is the link:  
[ Critical MTGO bug- Effects with life gain effects that count game objects can be applied infinitely, either hard locking a match or instantly winning"

"Honestly outside of maybe 5 and Arlinn the rest just seem like hot garbage.

Also Wizards why print a legendary like Tovolar (who is insane for the deck) but not print more 1 and 2 drops to go with?

2) One block of 4 sets per year that share themes/mechanics and some keywords and are in the same plane. No core set.

3) Two blocks of 2 sets for each per year. No core set (ixalan, Rivals of Ixalan ; Kaladesh, Aether revolt)

4) Individual sets that share keywords/game mechanics but that are not in the same plane.

5) Individual sets that don't share themes/mechanics or keywords, but are in the same plane (Ravnica Allegiance, War of the Spark)

6) Individual sets that have nothing to do with each other (Dominaria, Throne of Eldraine, Theros beyond death)

7) Individual sets that share one theme/mechanic (current system)

"So I wanted to try DnD stuff on paper to play with friends, but it seems like there is only a Commander decks. And i loved the themed decks(60cards) they used to print. So is it forbidden from Commander format and on? [Paper] So does WOTC ever do themed decks anymore?"
"Disclaimer: I love Throne of Eldraine and Adventures in the Forgotten Realms. 

Ok, we are a couple of days away from rotation. This rotation is a bit bittersweet. On one hand, Throne of Eldraine has been very oppressive in standard, giving very few room to breath to every set printed after it. So good riddance! On the other hand, I feel like we missed something. 

You see, with the pandemic I feel there was basically no chance to really go out and play many of the sets that are leaving standard. And well, Eldraine never gave many sets a chance to truly shine and be enjoyed. It feels like a huge shame. 

So I've been thinking, why not make a custom format to let this happen? In this way I want to make a simple proposal: Make a new format to recover this lost standard. So this is my initial proposal for this format: Lost Epoch 

Introducing: Lost Epoch

Lost Epoch is intended as an accessible, modern-frame, stable format intended to have an environment where less valued cards can get exploited to their maximum potential, and decks can have an extended lifetime. Lost Epoch could also be a cheaper alternative to Modern and Pioneeer. 

Game mode: 60+ card deck + 15 card sideboard, Best of three, Best of one.  

Initial Card pool: Cards from Ikoria land of Giants, Theros Beyond Death and Core 2021.

Cards exclusive to supplementary products -planeswalker decks, theme boosters, promo-only cards, collector boosters, and box toppers- are not included in the pool.    

Banlist

* [Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath] (


Growing the card pool.

The card pool can grow in the following ways:

Rotating in: Sets in standard can be included after they rotate out of standard provided they don't prove oppressive or disruptive. The community would have to decide upon rotation. For example, if the community decides AFR is too disruptive and full of parasitic mechanics, then AFR wouldn't rotate in next year.  


Why wait a year before including new sets? Because that way we can filter incoming sets and make sure we keep a diverse playing field.   

Also, this keeps the format affordable; cards are cheaper upon rotation. 


By reprints: Individual cards can join the format upon being reprinted. Provided they satisfy the following conditions:

* The reprinted card has been in standard before.

* The reprint is widely available.

* The card isn't in a set that was explicitly excluded.  

* The reprint happens on or after September, 17th.  

What is considered widely available for he purposes of getting into the format? I consider a card is safe to include if it satisfy at least three of the following criteria:

* The reprinted card is available on draft boosters or pre-con decks.

* The reprinted card is available on foreign languages.

* The reprinted card is available as common or uncommon.

* The reprint happens in a premiere set.

* The reprinted card is available at less than $10 or it's equivalent. 



So, what does the community think? Am I out of my mind on this or does it have a future? Are there other suggestions?


Ramblings: 

Could there be rotation out? Maybe give six years for a set and five years for cards after being reprinted? Or maybe keep it eternal?

Should we also preemptively ban Lurrus and Yorion? With this rotation I feel like we missed a standard. (A little rant + a proposal)"

Something was just changed and you didn’t want it to? Just Rule 0 it. In this way, Rule 0 is solely used to shut down legitimate discussion and criticism of the commander format. Rule 0 is not an excuse to have a poorly defined format.

And of course, every time someone brings up Rule 0, someone else rightly points out that it only really works if you have a consistent playgroup. And even though commander is more casual than other formats, I would say that Rule 0 is primarily a feature of having a playgroup and not of the commander format. If you have a playgroup, you can do things like a no-banlist Modern night, a cube with ante cards, or Standard Emperor. I’m lucky enough to have a consistent playgroup, and we’ve done plenty of experimentation in and out of commander. 

And no, before anyone says it, I’m not mad about the recent banning/unbanning, I think both were at least arguable. In the discussion *about* that banning/unbanning, however, I have seen endless people use Rule 0 as a rhetorical dead-end. People need to stop using Rule 0 as a cure-all to problems in commander. Rule 0 and its consequences have been a disaster for the commander format"
"My wife will be attending her first prerelease for MID this weekend, but she's still pretty new to Magic and has only really played games of mashing together Jumpstart packs (though she's had a great time with that). She's been lukewarm about trying other formats because she's not too into deckbuilding in general, but is a big horror fan and we've heard that prerelease events are more welcoming to newer players, so she was interested in giving it a shot. I mostly play commander these days and haven't been to a prerelease for quite a few years and I feel like this set has a lot of more finicky mechanics, so I was hoping to get some recommendations on any particular resources or other tips to help her have a good first experience!

"I was recently looking for a case to carry 3 EDH decks double sleeved. I don't like having each deck in a separate box, I prefer to have one case with all decks, tokens and dice. I found a TCC video with Quiver Time Bolt which seemed perfect for me and I bought it. Unfortunately, I found it to be tricky and annoying to put cards in the case and pull them out because of the material covering the sides inside the case, which easily catches on sharp corners of sleeves and stops them from moving midway through. Overall I'm not satisfied with this product.

Do you have any recommendations for such a case other than Quiver? Recommendations For A Carrying Case For 3 EDH Decks"
"You can start purchasing tickets for the Gencon events this week starting now, and you receive your tokens immediately, and they can be redeemed since it is past downtime.

Plus you get entry into that event.  You'll still have to pay for the non-Gencon events on MTGO, but it's a chance to get ahead in new standard (or play whatever on MTGO!)

"If you go to the [Secret Lair website]( you see that they have sections called ""current sale"" and ""past sales""

As expected ""past sales"" has all the things you can't buy anymore, but the confusing part is that the same is true for ""current sales""

Let's say you wanted to buy [the one for Kamigawa]( here we see two conflicting statements

One says this is ""no longer available"" which is unexpected given that we are browsing the ""current sales"" section, but also we see it has a release date for December 13, 2021, which would mean it's not available yet, right?

So which one is it?, will it be possible to purchase it in December 13th?, is it no longer available for good?, if so... what are the current sales then?, where can I see what products are available?

"I play decks with goals other than winning in Arena, and for a while one of my primary focuses has been what my friend calls terrarium setups- creating a board state where I can safely observe my opponent and simply watch what their deck does. A key element of this is being set up such that you do not need to respond to anything the opponent could possibly do (in Arena this means turning on auto-pass).

I believe this is possible to do in Arena (I'll expand on that in a comment). Do you think this is possible in bigger formats like Modern or Legacy, or even in casual play with no ban list whatsoever? Ideally you want your setup to restrict your opponent as little/as specifically as possible, as the goal is to observe how their deck would typically function against other opponents.

What are some of the cards that would be most problematic? Can you think of any ways to prevent their effects? Can a deck set up an unloseable board state with all the cards in Magic?"

After many years of not playing Magic I got into the game again while in lockdown last year and fell back in love with the game I was obsessed with as a kid. Long story short I'm getting married next year and do not want some crazy bachelor party. So I had the thought to just have a draft/sealed night likely 8 of us which I've never done. Some of the guys already play others don't and those of us who do play mostly if not exclusively EDH. So I'd love some advice on what sets and format to look at. So I have no idea whether to draft or play sealed and if edh is the way to go. But Im thinking getting 2 boxes a Commander Legends (2020) box and maybe new set from 2022. I'm hesitant to do the D&amp;D Commander box because I don't like the dungeon mechanics but we'll see. But leaning towards a Kamigawa or New Capenna box to go with the Legends one. Maybe Double Masters if everyone want to chip in extra. Before anyone recommends dominaria or brothers they will most likely come out too late in the year for this. Any way appreciate the help and advice in advance!!! Bachelor Party Help!!!

"I play commander every weekend.

Have you ever been sat at a table bored to death while someone cycles infinite turns and plays each turn out? I have. Its been several times. If someone demonstrates the loop and declares infinite turns, the pod scoops after probing for a way to kill the table. This sucks and makes for some feel bad situations. It's gotten to the point where I know the people who have infinite turn combos at my LGS. My play group just moves somewhere else if they try to get a game with us. I feel like a scumbag for alienating them, but I actually want to play Magic. I don't want to shuffle, cut, draw and play 4 turns unable to cast anything significant, only to have them declare infinite turns. This is why I play commander, I want a long game with some interesting stuff to happen. Of I wanted to play for 15 to 20 minutes I would play modern or even standard.

Why not cap the number of turns a player can take in succession? For instance, I would limit this number to 5 turns. 1 initial turn and 4 potential extras. This way they can cast an Expropriate and still end up with 4 time votes. You can also cast and copy a Time Stretch. This doesn't prevent anybody from having a good gaming experience and it doesn't make people feel as if they shuffled for nothing.

I just want to hear some thoughts on this. The game rules can be changed for better game balance. Why Not Cap Infinite Turn Combos?"

4 [[delver of Secrets]] 
4 [[magmatic channeler]] 
2 [[suspicious stowaway]] 
1 [[Sea gate stormcaller]] 
1 [[spectral adversary]]

3 [[reject]] 
3 [[frost bite]] 
4 [[consider]] 
4 [[play with fire]] 
4 [[expressive iteration]] 
2 [[jwari disruption]] 
2 [[prismari command]] 

19 lands:
4 [[den of the bug bear]] 
4 [[river glide pathway]] 
10 [[snow island]] 
1 [[snow mountain]]

This is just the WIP, so no sideboard yet.

**The boys:**
Delver is the star of the show, but needs some backup singers to hold the band together. Magmatic channeler and poppet stitcher and great. Big for cheap and go wide and very good strategies and covers our bases in a lot of matchups. I considered [[smoldering egg]] and with the flash back off the possible inclusion of [[otherworldly gaze]] it could be very viable. Imrith is our go long plan, and can win with all of our disruption late game. 


**Ways to flip:**

There are very few ways to ensure a flip, our best option is to turn 2 the delver and hold up play with fire or fading hope. I've been looking at the sad ponder pretender,][otherworldly gaze]], and although the flashback intrigued me, it feels bad. Who knows, could be necessary though.

**The spells:**

Lots of disruption and lots of interaction. Burn spells and counters have been delvers friend since day one. The snow lands let the frost bite be ""free"" although I've considered playing [[you see a guard approach]] for disruption or [[behold the multiverse]] for card draw, and even [[saw it coming]] as a replacement for the rejects. The prismari commands find answers and get us mana boost to cast our Imrith if ever necessary.

**The lands:**

Den of the bug bear is our beater. This thing may close games that go long and are creatures 17-20 to fill out the roster.

Let me know if this is straight gas or if it's just another [[garbage fire]]. 2021 Delver! or How I learned to stop worrying and love the Aboration!"

Looking for some suggestions on cards to include in a janky Gnostro deck that focuses on casting cheap spells and untapping creatures (generally Gnostro) . One of the win cons is dealing damage with Gnostro to stuffy doll/brash taunter. I don't want that to the be only one but it was something I thought was interesting and requires enough work to not be unfair. Maybe adding fevered visions would be good to ping players to bring down life totals.

I'm totally open to some fun interaction. I want this deck to feel fresh and not a solitaire deck. I understand there might be some turns where I cast a lot of spells but I plan to be efficient and know what I want to do so I don't drag out turns. I know storm would be good here. 

Added a decklist. It's really random so far. Probably will have a lot of cuts and additions. Just thought I'd get some ideas and maybe you can share some cool cards that would be fun for me and the table that would feel like something new! Thanks in advance!

I don’t have many people that I know that play and the closest lgs is about an hour from where I live. 

Is it feasible to just collect the cards? I love pack breaking but would also consider playing the game if I could find people. Also is there any more sets that are recent that have better arts than the dnd set? 

From what I understand cards that hold value are cards that have really good play value. But I don’t care much about the value.

I'm currently collecting all MH2 prerelease promos but for some reason I'm unable to find some, for example, the promo for [[Riptide Laboratory]] is in MTGGoldfish and Scryfall databses but can't be found anywhere.

Is there a list or perhaps a website I could use in order to know which card were printed with the prerelease stamp? Is this normal for certain rares/mythics not to be date-stamped?

"I've always been interested in trying Magic and recently purchased the 2021 Arena Starter Kit so that me and my brother could play some matches. I've really been enjoying my time and wanted to purchase some other decks or maybe even make a deck myself. I'm looking into either Pioneer or Standard, my current budget isn't very high and both formats seemed to be on the cheaper side. My question is, should I wait with purchasing cards until after rotation or should I just go for it? If I end up playing Pioneer more I don't think it would matter that much, Standard is a whole other story though. Do metas change drastically when sets rotate?

"Hey,

I've got recently my hands on a playset of \[\[Jhoira of the Ghitu\]\]. I had always liked that card and I wonder how to build a deck around her.

While I have nothing concrete so far, my idea is to put \~5-6 hard to remove large creatures, and the rest of the deck being some counters and draw, with some time counter manipulators.

What do you think? How to make her fun? How would you build Jhoira of the Ghitu deck for casual Modern?"

What about Colossal Plow? (I think no)

"My interest peaked for MTG around late 2019 and I started to get into it just before COVID started, now it’s been over a year and I’m sorta out of touch. I still have that spark of interest but I know the game has evolved over the course of a year and a half or so. My main experience with Magic was playing commander and drafts at my local game shop. Since then I moved and was wanting to get back into playing since COVID seems to be calming down where I’m at .

I was mainly wondering if there is any Youtube  channels, or websites that are friendly to semi-new comers. Or even any suggestions on deck ideas.

"Hey fellow commander players,

Long story short, I built my Kaalia of the Vast deck as one of my first commander decks ever and am in the process of tearing it down and rebuilding it now that my knowledge base has grown considerably.

My question for other Kaalia pilots, what is your creature counts? I've got 11 Angels, 11 Dragons, 9 Demons and 4 creatures none of those types for a total of 35.

In your experiences, is this too creature heavy?

Lastly, there isn't any chaff creatures in the deck. Each of the 3 kinds Kaalia plays for free has great ETB effects and the 4 others are enhancement creatures. I mean, there's always trimming you can do and I can get rid of a couple of redundancies, but, it's kind of nice having multiple ways to kill creatures or control the battlefield without having to cast instants or sorceries so I can save those for big threats.

Any advice is appreciated as I almost exclusively play control and this will be my first deck that tries to win by face bashing. Kaalia of the Vast Creature Count"

This deck is made entirely of cards from Innistrad (excluding the commanders) and is meant to be a little lower in power level (around the level of a precon).

"Extremely dumb question. The new Coven keyword ability from Midnight Hunt. In order for the ability to properly trigger (or to activate), do I need to control at least creatures with different powers?

Example: 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, and 4/1. Four creatures, but the powers 1, 2, 3 are enough and trigger Coven. If I play an additional 1/1 creature and/or if the 4/1 creature is removed, Coven will continue unaffected. Is this correct?

OR, must I control at three or more creatures, each with different powers?

Example: 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, and 4/1. Four creatures and each must have different power in order for Coven to trigger. If I play a 1/1 creature, Coven will no longer come into effect. Is this correct?

I want to start over with him. I gifted my old cards to people over the last years so I got almost no collection. Just a few lands and some of my favourite cards. We both want to buy the deckbuilding set (100lands and a few boosters) and one display. We figured that best to start playing would be the draft booster, is that correct? Back in my days there were only one booster type so this is all new for me. 

Besides the booster type we don't know which set we should buy. We want to build decks that could actually be ""good"" while we don't care about rotation, banned stuff and so on. We just want to build one (preferably more) deck(s) and have fun together. Is there a set that is overall pretty strong in terms of power?

"Because Math is Fun™. (Disclaimer: It was kinda fun)

So, today I saw the MIC commander [Kyler, Sigardian Emissary]( on the front page, and shared it with a buddy of mine. I run a Rick, Steadfast Hero commander deck, and suggested I might enjoy making a Human deck instead of a Soldier deck. 

He liked the concept, and then ran down a rabbit hole asking me to figure out the math, because he didn't want to. (The lazy bum).

Anyway, here's the setup:

You cast each of these cards 4 times: [[Primal Vigor]], [[Doubling Season]], [[Annointed Procession]], [[Parallel Lives]], and then put [[Castle Ardenvale]] onto the battlefield.

Activate it's second ability. How many tokens do you get?

* X = Creature Tokens At End of Turn
* Y = Creature Tokens Initially Created
* Z = Number of Doubling Cards on the Battlefield

That math is simple:

    X=Y*2^Z 

or 

    X=1*2^16

Activate Castle Ardenvale 1 time under these circumstances, and you'll get 65,536 creatures.

So, then he modified the question a bit and threw out a bunch more cards. (You cast these *before* activating Castle Ardenvale, for the purposes of this math problem:

4 copies of: [[Soul Warden]], [[Soul's Attendant]], [[Ajani's Welcome]], [[Suture Priest]], [[Essence Warden]], [[Cleric Class]], [[Angel of Vitality]], [[Angelic Chorus]], [[Alhammeret's Archive]]. and [[Boon Reflection]]. 

1 copy of [[Trostani, Selesnya's Voice]], and then one copy of [[Kyler, Sigardian Emissary]].

Kyler gets cast last.

What's your life gain the first time you use the Castle Ardenvale, and how about the second time?

* X = Total Life Gained each Turn
* Y = Total Creature Tokens ETB
* A = Number of Cards that give you +1 life per Creature that ETB
* B = Number of cards + 1 each time you gain life
* C = Number of Cards where you gain life equal to the Toughness of a creature that ETB
* D = Toughness Increase
* E = Number of Cards that Double other effects
* F = Base Toughness

The formula for this ended up looking like:

    X = (Y*((A*B)+A)*(C*((D+F)*Y))*2^E)

Plugging in numbers for turn 1:

    X=(65,536*((20*8)+20)*(5*((0+1)*65,536))*2^8)

So

    X = 989,560,464,998,400

Turn 1, with these cards in play, you would gain 989,560,464,998,400 life. Kyler would also gain 65,536 +1/+1 counters, the 65,356 1/1 creatures you just created would have Power/Toughness of 65,537/65,537.

Now on to turn 2. Plugging in the appropriate values, we get this:

    X = (65,536*(20*8)+20)*(5*((1+65,536)*65,536))*2^8)

Just to break this down: 

* 65,536 is the number of tokens being created.
* 20 is the number of cards that give +1 life every time a creature ETB.
* 8 is the number of support cards that give us 1 life whenever we gain life.
* 5 is the number of cards that care about toughness.
* 1 is the base toughness of the creatures being created.
* 65,356 is the number of counters on Kyler, which will cause all the humans to ETB with 65,537 toughness. 
* 8 is the number of doubling cards we have in play

Total:

    X = 64,852,824,194,600,100,000

Turn 2, with these cards in play, you would gain 64,852,824,194,600,100,000 life. Kyler would gain another 65,536 +1/+1 counters, bringing his total to 131,072 - which is the same number of human creature tokens you would have. Their power and toughness would be equal to 131,073.

So I thought I was done here, but another friend of mine suggested I throw out a full playset of [[Parallel Evolutions]], with Flashback, to see what that does to the number. 

There are two ways this can play out. I'm going to do the smaller one first, and then the larger one.

If you cast all 4 parallel evolutions on the same turn, and then use their flashback abilities, your total amount of life gained is this number:

    2,617,038,667,108,010,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

Which is a ***very, very, very*** large number. Not to oversell it or anything.

We can't just run the same formula we have been to get there, though, because Parallel Evolution doubles ALL creature tokens each time, not just one. 

So back to our first formula:

    X = 131,072*(2^17)

Why 17? Because Parallel Evolutions is in play now, giving us a 17th Doubling Effect. 

That gives us a value of:

    X = 17,179,869,184

The rest of the problem can proceed as normal through the formula:

    X =(17,179,869,184*((20*8)+20)*(5*(1+131,072)*17,179,869,184))*2^8

Let's break these numbers down again. I'm only going to talk about the numbers that changed:

* 17,179,869,184 is the number of creature tokens created by Parallel Evolution.
* 131,072 is the number of counters (modified toughness) on Kyler)

This gives us the following answer:

    X = 8,913,236,284,932,090,000,000,000,000,000

Turn 2, after casting Parallel Evolution 1 time, you'll have gained an additional 8,913,236,284,932,090,000,000,000,000,000 life, put an additional 17,179,869,184 creature tokens onto the battlefield, for a total of 17,180,000,256. That's the number of +1/+1 counters on Kyler, which means your 1/1 human creature tokens have a power and toughness each equal to 17,180,000,257.

And you still have 7 more to go through!

The larger version is basically slowing your roll so you only cast Parallel Evolutions one time per turn. That gives you the initial creation of 65,536 extra humans each turn, which will feed Kyler, and increase your total numbers. Unfortunately, Excel doesn't get super-granular, so I'm not sure exactly what that number would be, but it's still bigger than just casting all of the Parallel Evolutions on the same turn. 

But seriously, do you really need to wait at that point?

TL;DR:

If you have a playset of each of these cards: Primal Vigor, Doubling Season, Annointed Procession, Parallel Lives, Soul Warden, Soul's Attendant, Ajani's Welcome, Suture Priest, Essence Warden, Cleric Class, Angel of Vitality, Angelic Chorus, Alhammeret's Archive, and Boon Reflection, and a single copy of Castle Ardenvale, Trostani, Selesnya's Voice, and Kyler, Sigardian Emissary, and then cast Parallel Evolution, you can crash your in-person Paper Magic game with a Real Life™ Stack Overflow error.

"I really liked them, it was my first commander product, especially because of the lower price. 40$, atleast to a student with not as much disposable income as me, felt like way too much to casually buy.  But after the last ones, we've been seeing the 40$ ones only. When I saw that there were two MID ones, I got excited for the zombies deck, but both are at the higher price point. Is this the end for them? Did they not sell well or something? The most obvious idea that comes to my mind is that wotc/hasbro just wants more money as always.

I know this card is not the best for highly optimized play and I'm not asking for competitive lists (I'm playing in a fairly casual setting), just some cards/combos/gameplans that can work with the card since I'm pretty new to modern and still don't have a lot of experience with the format itself and deckbuilding for it.

"Hello all,
I have a terrible lord question. I’ve been running a D&amp;D game set on Innistrad. (Army of the Damned is free and great)
Something happened, I always secretly roll for players and then see if they’re a planeswalker. One of mine this time got the 100 and is. (I know these aren’t the actual odds but it’s D&amp;D and fun so whatever.)

Anyways, to me it always seems that planes people walk to for the first time were random, but a little connected for their chats their arc in some way. So I created a list of all planes that interact with religion or spirits in a large way as the character was a Priest of Bruna. 
ANYWAYS, he rolled into Tarkir. 


So what I don’t know is this, which Tarkir does he visit? This game takes place before the time travel shenanigans so I’m not sure. I know the time trace changes only impact the plane itself but what about planeswalkers in between? Would this character walk into original timeline Tarkir and then if he left before the reset potentially come back to new timeline Tarkir? 

Sorry, this is a headache. Headache of a Lore Question"

"Hey guys,  
  
I've been working on some new brews for Innistrad standard and was hoping to get your thoughts on this Bant grave shenanigans brew.  
  
Here's a link to the deck:  
  
  
  
Discussion of cards:  
  
4 Otherworldly Gaze: This may look like a shitty Brainstorm, but I don't think it's supposed to be used that way. I think this is actually a self-mill card. 1 mana to mill 3 at instant speed isn't too bad, and it has flashback too! So you can use it twice if cast from hand, or can cast it from the grave if it gets milled or discarded.  
  
4 Deathbonnet Sprout - a 1 mana card that becomes a 3/3 that can keep growing is a strong payoff and one of the reasons I wanted to try brewing this deck.   
  
4 Willow Geist - another 1 mana creature that has the potential to cascade into a more substantial threat. Almost every card in the deck has the potential to either be cast from the grave, or to remove other cards from the grave. In total there are 28 cards in the deck with the potential to trigger the Geist, so I feel it shouldn't be too difficult to grow this into a substantial threat. The incidental life gain could be relevant against aggro or burn decks as well.  
  
2 Fateful Absence - looks like solid removal  
  
2 Malevolent Hermit - anti control / sweeper tech that comes on a body and can be disturbed from the grave. All of the disturb cards provide a form of card advantage which is nice.  
  
4 Devoted Grafkeeper - helps fill the graveyard, and the disturb half is actually a decently costed evasive beater. The tap ability could incidentally be useful to tap down opposing attackers or blockers. 
  
3 Dennick, Pious Apprentice - the front half is a decently costed body which blocks well. The clue generation on the back half is good anti-removal tech and provides a good source of card advantage. He also protects your graveyard and comes back as an evasive beater. 
  
1 Faithful Mending - fixing your draws, dumping creatures into the yard, and flashback all look good. The incidental life gain is an OK bonus too. It may be correct to run more but I don't want the deck to be too slow and clunky so trying 1 for now.   
  
3 Eccentric Farmer - probably the least ""playable"" card in the deck, but it's not that bad. It contributes to the self mill plan while affecting the battlefield, and can help mana fix as well. Plus it's probably the most flavorful card in the set.  
  
1 Slogurk, the Overslime - looks like a good payoff for milling yourself. Can self bounce once you hit 3 counters which could be relevant against removal or sweepers and getting some lands back out of the yard is just gravy.  
  
2 Borrowed Time - solid removal that can hit anything  
  
2 Wrenn and Seven - contributes to the self mill plan, the token she creates can help beat down or defend as needed, and her ultimate gets everything back from the grave!  
  
4 Sigardian Savior - good source of card advantage on an evasive body. Looks like a good self mill payoff - 3 creatures in one!  
  
So, do you guys have any suggestions or thoughts on the deck? Let me know what you think! Brewing Bant Grave Shenanigans for Innistrad Standard"

"As the title says, not trying to be mean or anything, just genuinely curious. 

My playgroup detests Eldrazi and every time they're put down, it never remains on the battlefield for more than a turn cycle. It just paints a huge target on the head of the person playing them, and in my opinion, just hurts gameplay. When my friend can keep playing [[Emrakul, The Promised End]] repeatedly in EDH, it results in more scoops than game completions.

Don't get me wrong, I like the lore of the Eldrazi. And their design, once upon a time, while broken was unique. But I believe that one or two sets was enough to deal with them and now we can move on. Heck, I'd even prefer more Praetors over Eldrazi!

I know some people were upset that there were no Eldrazi in Midnight Hunt but I was personally thrilled! SOI and Eldritch Moon were okay, but I prefer the original horror themes of Innistrad over the Lovecraftian, Cronenbergian style those sets were going for.

Again, this is just my opinion and I'd love to hear if there are any others in the MTG community that feel the same or thinks I'm dead wrong. Either way, I'd love to hear what you have to say!

**TLDR; Not a fan of more Eldrazi, looking to hear what others have to say.** This might be an unpopular question/opinion but...why do people want more Eldrazi?"

"Hi everyone. 

I am currently running of sealed at my LGS, and many people wish to have a new one launch with the next set. Here are my goals : 

Have a weekly rating to give extra rewards for the top 3.
Have a global rating to crown a league winner.

Here is current system :
Every week the rating is simply your win vs total match ration. You have to play 3 matchs per week to be ranked.
Every week you score a number of points depending on your rating for the global one (10 for 1st 9 dor 2nd etc).

The global system works as intended, but the weekly one has lead to a huge issue : if a player is 3-0, he stops playing for the week (or agrees with his opponent to not record the match before playing) to guarantee a first place. Only the players with at least 1 defeat in the first 3 matchs keep playing for fun. And I have had to explain to 9 year old who was so proud to be 8-1 for the first time (really good record for such a young player) that he got no loots because 3 players stopped playing after their 3 matchs. He felt it was unfair and frankly do do I. Making 3-0 or even 4-0 is much easier than making a GP day 2 record. 

I would like for my weekly system to give more credit to a good ratio with more wins, but I also don't want the people who can only play 1 day a week to feel they can't compete anymore (we have both unemployed people who play 30 matchs a week, kids who can only come on saturdays for 6-8 matchs and working people who do 4 matchs before FNM, and I want as many people to enjoy the league. 

I am all ears for any suggestions! Thanks !

Td:dr : My current league system makes people try to win their first 3 matchs in a week and then stop playing to preserve their ratio. I want them to play ! Trying to improve my league's rating system ?"
"Hi everyone, wanted to hear people opinion on how to handle math in commander games when it becomes overwhelming,

The other day I was playing EDH with my usual group of friends and I had on the battlefield: Veyran + Thousand Years Storm, coupled with Brass's Bounty, Mind's Desire and another couple of effects. Useless to say that to calculate everything became soon a nightmare.

My Veyran deck is the premade one with like 12 different cards and I did avoid to make it too powerful, but when I play I'm honestly concerned that if I play it at best it is going to become a nightmare to not make mistake in calculating spells and effects.

Now, I'm a pretty experience player and I did play many different style of deck in my 20y+ career, so this is not a beginner problem, and I do like spellslinging as concept, just I feel that this style of EDH deck is not suitable for physical play, due to the time needed to calculate all the multiplier effects, that is going to end up in boring everyone else at the table or push them to concede.

I'm thinking at least to de-power more the deck by removing the Thousand Years Storm, but I'd appreciate to hear some suggestion on this topic. And please avoid the ""just use another deck"", I do have plenty of other decks but I want to be able to use the spellslinging one every now and then. Also I feel this is an objectively real problem, in particular after Strixhaven and all its copy effect.

Any suggestion?

"I'm trying to summarize the story of Gideon for a friend that doesn't play MTG. Am I missing anything? Did I get anything wrong?

Also, would it work to add some card images in the story?

(Theros, Born of the Gods) Kytheon Iora was born on Theros.  He led a group of vigilante orphans, known as Kytheon's Irregulars, in fighting crime in Akros. This continued until he grew too cocky and decided to attack a god. Heliod, the god in question, killed the rest of the Irregulars. Kytheon only survived due to a magical form of invulnerability, and the tragedy Sparked him, and he planeswalked away. 

\[I feel like I'm missing some story here, post-Theros, pre-Battle for Zendikar. When did he change his name, for one?\]

(Battle for Zendikar, Oath of the Gatewatch) On Zendikar, Gideon is involved in a fight between Zendikar itself and the Eldrazi, horrors from another plane(?). He, along with three other planeswalkers (Jace, Chandra, Nissa), form the Gatewatch,  an organization of planeswalkers designed to fight injustice across the Multiverse.

(Shadows over Innistrad, Eldritch Moon) The Eldrazi end up on Innistrad, where they ravage that plane as much as they did Zendikar. They are held off by Liliana and an army of zombies she raises (with the aid of the Chain Veil, an artifact that increases planeswalker's power), and imprisoned by Sorin. (Eldrazi can never be truly killed, only held off for a time.) Liliana joins the Gatewatch.

(Amonkhet, Hour of Devastation) To this end, they investigate another plane, Amonkhet. They were told by Ugin (an ally in the battle for Zendikar but not part of the Gatewatch), that something sinister is happening there. They travel to Amonkhet, and find Nicol Bolas, an Elder Dragon, has been scheming and raising a zombie army for centuries. They further investigate, learning of some of his plans. In a final battle between the Gatewatch and Bolas, which leads to the near-destruction of the plane, most of the dead - and Amonkhet's gods - are converted to Bolas's army. The Gatewatch lose badly, and barely escape in time. 

(Dominaria) Most of the Gatewatch (minus Jace) ends up on Dominaria. There, they kill four demons that have bound Liliana to their will, freeing her from the contract. They also reforge a sword known as  Blackblade, that is the only known weapon that has killed an Elder Dragon, in hopes of using it against Bolas. Jace returns from Ixalan with the Immortal Sun, the only known way of stopping a planeswalker from planeswalking. They assemble a plan to defeat Bolas, and go to Ravnica in order to execute the plan, with Teferi, another planeswalker, joining the Gatewatch.

(War of the Spark) On Ravnica, Jace's word is law. Their plan involves using this to hold Bolas in place (legally for destruction of property), while Gideon kills Bolas with the Blackblade. Bolas, having planned this for centuries, can temporarily stop Jace's ability by disrupting Ravnica's leylines. He then summons his army of the dead from Amonkhet, led by Liliana, who is trapped by a hidden clause in her contract. If she disobeys Bolas, she will die. For almost a day, there is all-out war in Ravnica's streets. The Gatewatch, Ravnica natives, and other planeswalkers try to improvise other plans, as Bolas's Elderspell steals the Sparks from other planeswalkers, trying to give himself the power of a god. The Elderspell is channeled through his zombie army - if they get a good grip on any planeswalker, the Planeswalker dies and their Spark is given to Bolas. Gideon gets another shot at Bolas with Blackblade - and it fails to kill him. After some thought, Liliana executes a suicide attack, using the power of the zombie gods to turn the Elderspell back on Bolas. Gideon sacrifices himself - gifting his invulnerability - to save Liliana and allow her to despark Bolas. Gideon's lore summary - am I missing anything?"

"Does anyone notice the worrying trend of how WOTC handle their digital game releases ?

We all know the stories about magic online,

Then they created MTG: Arena which has increasing issues lately (late Jumpstart: Historic release and the recent Mythic-related hoohaa),

Magic: Legends shut down few months after release,

And they also bombed the latest D&amp;D Dark Alliance release (Metacritic 53%, IGN 4/10)

What do you guys think? Believe they have a group of very competent people running their paper magic biz, but why they always screw up when it comes to the online product? WOTC Screw Up Every Digital Game They Released (MTG Arena, Magic Online, Magic Legends, etc)"
The card I have to choose from are never as good as my opponents.  Mostly in how well the work together. I have been playing all the way back to fourth edition and have been playing arena for two weeks now and I'd put my money on this being the case. Does anyone else think in MTG arena they use premade decks a computer plays in the draft games. Seems like they do to me so you don't win as much and have to buy more.

"So I’m building a mono red deck with the main idea being, make a bunch or 1/1 tokens and then make a lot of damage.

Using cards like [Goblin Instigator]( and [Goblin Gathering](

But I have come at an impasse regarding the last 12 cards to add.

I originally wanted to make it sort of like an 8 whack deck, so I added [Reckless Bushwhacker]( and [Burning-Tree Emissary]( because you know, shit crazy

But then I found [Cavalcade of Calamity]( and maybe its better? Like it does not give haste but if everything is a 1/1, its like a whack every turn.

I don’t know what to do, I mean I could add all the cards but the lack of synergy between them really annoys me, I mean if drop down a Bushwhacker, then for that turn the Cavalcade does nothing.

So, I came looking for advice, what do you think its better to fill the last 12 cards

"Hey everyone,

Reposted as this had ""PSA"" in the title, which caused it to be autobanned.

Sort of a PSA, sort of a complaint - I wouldn't normally post about a bug here or in the spikes/MTGA subreddits but we're at our wits' end, the new set is four days away and at this point the only thing I can think of is to try and get something visible to a large group.

Two weeks ago I posted this bug on the Wizards feedback forum: [

There are two parts to the bug. One is that players who reach Mythic on MTGA have their ranks set to beginner; that's irritating, but actually not a huge deal.

The much larger bug is that people who reach Mythic in the middle of an event (eg. a draft) become unable to progress, in **any events at all**; their wins and losses simply do not count. I haven't been able to confirm whether this is also happening to players who reach Mythic in other situations. Initially it was thought that people could resign and play in other events, but it is affecting **all** events.

Basically, for anyone making Mythic, your account may just become useless. I haven't been able to play in an event since I made that post.

The bug has become so widespread that there are reports of some players unable to register wins or losses in yesterday's Arena Open protesting by repeatedly conceding games to help other players in the knowledge that they can never drop out of the tournament. Some streamers have responded by creating smurf accounts to avoid the issue.

People have bombarded Wizards with requests for information on when we can expect a fix and the only reported responses are along the lines of ""we  are too busy to give you a response"". There's been essentially no communication on when a fix can be expected, or any compensation announced for the affected players.

It's four days until the new set releases on Arena, and there's a very real possibility that we'll be unable to draft the new set because our games just don't register.

In short, this is completely insane, and the game is utterly broken for a big group of people through no fault of their own. :(

Thanks for reading, and apologies for having to resort to this but I just want to be able to play the game. Major bug in MTGA causing accounts to be effectively unplayable, still not fixed four days before Innistrad release"

"My wife and I started a game of magic with the starter deck.

She just started her main phase on her current turn. She tapped 2 red land cards. Then played Axgard Cavalry.

Card states:

Turn Symbol: Target creature gains haste until end of turn.

As I understand the rule - this card does not suffer summoning sickness, and immediately applies 2/2 damage to me during the main phase. As I have 0 blockers I take 2 damage (go wifey).

My questions are:

1. When the card is played during main phase is it tapped after or before the damage is applied?

Since I have no response to her during the main phase, we automagically move to the attack phase.

2. Does she untapped the Asgard Calvary creature and attack again, then tap it, and move onto the next phases until she declares her turn over?

3. On her next turn, after my turn has been completed, if that creature is still living 😱 and she then un-taps, up-keep, draws, and plays into the main phase - is haste still in play with this copy of Axgard Cavalry?

Thank you in advanced. The rule book and subsequent videos we watch did not answer these questions. Total Noob Question"

The product is a wasteful luxury, and knowing the company, they will come to the conclusion soon, or might have already figured it out. Whether they will act on it is to be determined. 

We have until 2025 to fully implement future changing solutions, and a global production shutdown of explicit luxury products will be one of the first things that will go in order to cut power and resource consumption if the world does decide to take the hint and decide it doesn't want to end in famine. 

Most companies, if they are going to participate, are going to start shutting down in 2 years with a year long liquidation and shutdown plan if they do happen chose to do the right thing...

Even if we do come out of 2027 in a better place (drastic emission reversal/huge carbon negative changes), there's no promise wotc will have the funds, the ability, or the economic landscape to reopen.

I don't want it to end, but I think it has to...

I freakin hate this timeline...

I love this game so much...


Dunno why I wrote this. Think it all just really clicked and it just kinda connected how awfully we are truly fucked given past trends and the awfully low probability of coming out of this ok due to the obvious pending failure of relying on corporations to do the right thing for the general public and not just the rich shareholders who are already prepared for this. The ""container house"" craze? The ""Doomsday Prepper"" shows? Rich people knew this was coming. They always have. They started building luxury shelters, and in true ironic fashion, a network exec noticed the uptick and decided to make a TV program out of it. Just another cruel joke to make a buck...

I won't be replying to any comments. It's not gonna matter. Downvotes and upvotes are just wasted electricity... like the wasted electricity i used to write this... I think I'm going to start trying to read more. I have a lot of books that I wanted to read... Prediction: Magic may end in 2 years."

"Hi y'all! So I'm wanting to make a fast paced deck for quick final games with my playgroup. I'd love for this to be as budget as possible. I was thinking that Zirda would be super awesome for it, but I want to use it as a companion, not as commander. I thought that black and blue would be fun and powerful additions to the boros colors required. Breya fits the requirements, so I figured Perfect!

MY PROBLEM: Zirda combos/ permanents that fit the companion requirements are basically impossible to search.... and I don't have a massive card databank in my head the way so many people seem to. I would greatly appreciate any help that y'all can offer! Budget Breya-Zirda"
"Hi there!

So, lately I've been getting back into arena (standard mostly) and I want to improve and win more consistently when MID comes out. But almost every tine I play, it's against a white lifegain deck and with the 10 prebuilt decks, I just can't seem to break through. Granted, those decks aren't optimal, but I would like to hear some tips about deckbuilding or facing lifegain decks.

Thanks in advance! I want help"

#### [[[Rem Karolus, Stalwart Slayer](

This card got me thinking... why spells? I remembered how copying spells have recently expanded from just instant or sorcery to everything. But it doesn't make sense... other than some niche Aura spells and Eldrazi cast triggers, this is effectively ""instant and sorcery"".

Then I remember what the next block is... Kamigawa. The set with Splice. And you know how wizards likes to seed the previous set with the next set's mechanics (see Spirits)?

What if Kamigawa has a Splice effect that instead of splicing onto a instant/sorcery, but instead it splices onto a permanent?? Recent mechanics like Mutate has shown that creature spells can target, and can have different results depending on whether the target fizzles. So as is, you can splice an card onto a creature, then have the effect happen as the card resolves just as the creature enters the battlefield.

So this hypothetical card:

\---

1R Laser Augment

Instant

\~ deals 2 damage to any target

Splice onto Creature 1RR

\---

If you splice it onto a creature spell, you can:

a) have the creature spell get countered, and nothing happens

b) have the target be invalid, then the 2 damage doesn't happen, but the creature still ETB.

c) have the target be valid, and 2 damage is dealt AND the creature ETB.

Thematically, it works, because splicing something onto a creature is both something that happens in anime, cyberpunk AND phyrexia; and splice onto is one of the cooler mechanics that gets remembered in Kamigawa to the point that they made a card in MH, AND they even made it phyrexian themed. This would be the perfect evolution to an old mechanic.

Mechanically, there is precedent. Mutate shows that the behaviour is not as rules nightmarish as it would be, and copy permanent spells shows that WoTC is willing to go there.

What do y'all think? Speculation on new Kamigawa mechanics"
"Ik Mtg's going through a developmental phase rn, with the return to blocks, but I've been really enjoying the lore ever since we started getting it free online again. Greg Weisman was fine at best, and  I think that the current lore team breaths life into the lore universe, to such an extent that I was more excited by their return than anything gameplay wise from the past 2 years of mtg. I hope wotc realises this, and if they do decide to monetise the lore, at least keep the current lore team for it, ofc the fact that the lore's free is also amazing when looking at it's quality. Does anyone else love the new lore?"
"I've played a ton of Horizon Jump Start, and while it's nowhere as polished and balanced as the paper one, i have been having a ton of fun and wanted to hear what people thought of the new digital mechanics.

My two cents:

I know any comparisons to hearthstone is almost exclusively used as an insult, and i think that's kinda unpleasant as it sometimes comes off as mocking people who like a different game. But before the closed beta for arena, hearthstone is how i got my card-fix, and i remember one expansion created a C-tier deck called ""hand paladin"". Kinda of a tempo control deck, where you buffed creatures in your hand and tried to balance playing as few creatures as possible in order to survive, until you could slam down 1 mana 12/12s. Kinda like a deaths shadow deck. And i LOVED that deck, my favourite deck in all the time i played HS, so i am a huge fan of Perpetually. By far my favourite mechanic in limited. In constructed the ""combo"" that forces a draw, needs to be addressed, but all in all i really love playing with it.

Seek i can imagine i might be in the minority on. One type of RNG we can all agree is essential in Magic is what you draw, i mean Companion was probably the most universally disliked mechanic since Ante. And if you've played enough commander, you likely have at least have someone mention how tutors kinda defeat one of the main attractions of singleton formats. And i think Seek is actually a really good compromise, allowing you to find A goblin, just not guaranteed Muxus every single time.

Perpetually is fun in limited, and while I'm playing around with merfolks in constructed and adore [[shoreline scout]], it is a mechanic i am slightly nervous about with a card like [[Tome of the Infinite]] that i really hope will never become part of any meta.

What do you guys think about the new mechanics? And what's everyone's favourite jumpstart deck you've found so far. Now that we've had some time to get over the shock and get to play with them, what do you think of the GAMEPLAY of the digital only mechanics?"
"This guy played this 2 mana artifact (I think?) against me that counters all spells if you don’t pay any colour to cast them, what is the name of it if anyone knows. Forgot the name of a card"
Like Bob for [[Dark Confidant]] or Gary for [[gray merchant of asphodel]]. Do you have a funny nickname for a cards name that might not be used by the larger community? Many cards have community funny nicknames. What is your personal nickname for card(s)?

"A bit late again, but this is the last time, I promise.  Because the spoilers are now all revealed.

And with this being revealed, this means I have to make some judgment calls on some questionable clues.  If there are any you think need fixing, let me know.

One I will say right now; the main reason I am putting Gavony Dawnguard instead of Sigarda’s Splendor for a second time is so that we can marvel in a world where there exists two forms of repeatable card draw in White.

MaRo’s List:  

* three popular mechanics previously seen on Innistrad return ([Flashback]( [Transform]( [Investigate](
* [a new drawback for creature tokens that lets us create them cheaper (""Decayed"", it can't block and when it attacks it is sacrificed at end of combat)](
* **[a white card that could potentially draw you a card each turn (Gavony Dawnguard, every time it flips between day and night you get to look at the top 4 of your library and add a creature with mana value 3 from among them to your hand)](
* [a popular *Innistrad* card gets reprinted (Delver of Secrets)](
* [a curse that transforms into a creature (Curse of Leeches, transforms into a Leech Horror at night and can reattach to a player during the day)](
* two permanents that can double something every turn ([Unnatural Growth, the P/T of your creatures until end of turn, triggers at start of each combat]( **[Angelic Enforcer, doubles your life total every time it attacks]( )
* [a mythic cycle with ""you may pay [COST] any number of times"" (the ""Adversary"" cycle features creatures that let you spend an extra cost repeatedly as they ETB; they enter with more counters the more you spend, and have an effect that scales with them)](
* [a four mana blue aura with ""You control enchanted creature."" (Grafted Identity, you also have to sac a creature but the enchanted creature gets +1/+1)](
* [A popular tournament card in multiple formats gets reprinted with its fifth piece of art. (Pithing Needle)](
* a character from Innistrad once mentioned in a short story finally gets a card in an Innistrad set ([Liesa, Forgotten Archangel]( first mentioned (not by name) in [""A Gaze Blank and Pitiless""]( though [Ludevic, Necrogenius]( and [Rem Karolus, Stalwart Slayer]( also count, appearing in [""Games""]( and [""Saint Traft and the Flight of Nightmares""]( respectively)
* [""If your life total would be reduced to 0 or less,"" (Enduring Angel, instead transform Enduring Angel and your life total becomes 3; if Enduring Angel doesn’t transform this way you lose the game)](
* **[""This spell costs 1 less to cast for each creature you attacked with this turn."" (Search Party Captain, a 3W 2/2 Human Soldier that draws a card on ETB](
* [""As [CARDNAME] enters the battlefield, note your life total."" (Sigarda’s Splendor, at the beginning of your upkeep, you draw a card if your current life total is higher than the noted one, then you note again; relevant as you also gain 1 life whenever you cast a white spell)](
* [""put a slime counter on up to one other target creature."" (Sludge Monster, when it ETBs or attacks; non-Horror creatures with slime counters on them become 2/2s and lose their abilities)](
* [""Creature tokens you control lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 3/3."" (Poppet Factory, a blue artifact that transforms from a creature that makes Decayed Zombie tokens)](
* [""Each instant and sorcery card in your graveyard has"" (Lier, Disciple of the Drowned, Flashback, with cost equal to the mana cost)](
* [""Instants and sorcery spells you cast cost X less to cast, where X is [CARDNAME]’s power."" (Vadrik, Astral Archmage, he gets a +1/+1 counter every time day turns to night and vice versa)](
* [""put that many +1/+1 counters on [CARDNAME], then create twice that many 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens"" (Tainted Adversary, the Black Adversary)](
* [""At the beginning of your end step, if you have exactly 13 life,"" (Jerren, Corrupted Bishop, you may pay 4BB to transform him into…]( [this guy]( 
* [""You may cast any number of the copies without paying their mana costs."" (Bloodthirsty Adversary, the Red Adversary exiles instants and sorceries with mana value 3 or less from your graveyard and copies them)](
* **Creature – Hippogriff Spirit ([Soul-Guide Gryff]( [Waildrifter](
* [Creature – Human Soldier Werewolf (Brutal Cathar)](
* [Creature – Dragon Egg (Smoldering Egg)](
* [Creature – Leech Horror (Leeching Lurker)](
* [Creature – Fungus Horror (Deathbonnet Hulk)](
* [Creature – Plant Horror (Rootcoil Creeper)](
* **[Creature – Drake Horror (Storm Skreelix)](
* [Creature – Demon Dog (Dreadhound)](
* [Legendary Creature – Ooze (Slogurk, the Overslime)](
* [Legendary Creature – Vampire Noble (Florian, Voldaren Scion)](

"I predict we are going to finally see Leshrac in his own card during the Brothers War set next year, probably as a planeswalker. He has been referenced in a handful of cards in the past and in lore was sealed in the shard of 12 world's during the Brother's War.

Is there a board game that uses similar resource system? It makes me think of something like Risk where you have to conquer territories and that’s where your resources to cast spells come from. 

Anyway, does that exist? I’m really loving MTG! Board game similar to MTG?"
"So... I bought into the ""fantasy"" of trying Magic the Gathering.  Fortunately, I have not invested a ton of money into it.  I basically have only the starter pack.  I have read the rules, but I find them very convoluted.  My wife and I have tried to figure this out together, watched a couple YouTubes, etc.  The game doesn't make a whole lot of sense to us.  So we thought we would try and play the iOS version of the game, since we have the MAG Arena starter deck codes.  Playing one another is quite fun, even though we really don't understand what the hell is going on.  How some of these cards accumulate so much power and all the sudden kicks the crap out of one of us.  Then there are mechanics where you need to apply something to someone, but that someone is really your enemy, but it lets it apply it to you, and you end up screwing your game because of it.    


Then I have finished playing through all the color scenarios, received my upgrades, an the first free deck of red/green cards.  I then tried my hand at PvP and just got pulverized.

Needless to say, even playing the MAG Arena is terribly frustrating.  I think this game is just not very friendly to new people starting out with basic decks of cards.  On top of that, I have no idea how I am going to do all the math properly and know how to use (or be able to identify when someone is cheating me).  So to wrap up my whining session...  


How do new people get involved in this?  
Did I just miss this boat, and just go find something else to play?  
If not, how do I proceed with learning this game and all the math and mechanics?    


I apologize, but I just find this more frustrating than fun, and it doesn't seem like it should be.  I don't want to invest a ton of money to try and keep up with the Jones, only to ultimately learn that there is really nothing I could ever do to find relevancy in this game.  So I thought I would come here for some ideas, encouragement, help, anything... What Gives?"

\-Humans have started an unusual alliance with the Witches of the forest

\-Arlinn PWs back to Innistrad to her old pack but finds that not only did Tovolar form his own super pack, but they fight and Arlinn's pack joins his.

\-Teferi PWs back and feels the effects of the day/moon (?) and investigates with Arlinn. They learn of the Celestas and that the key is found in Markov Manor

\-Sorin is back too and discovers that people have been snooping around his Manor 

\-Teferi and Arlinn bring the key to the witches who activate the ritual

\-Meanwhile, at a boiling point, Tovolar's pack attacks the harvest festival

\-As they are about to complete the ritual, Olivia appears and kills the lead witch, which only dooms the plane to eternal night, something the vampires really want.

It's a little weirder to me that we also have cards with different transform mechanics in innistrad: midnight hunt. e.g. [

&amp;#x200B;

I'll admit I had to re-read the wizards mechanics article a few times before grokking that mysterious tome wouldn't be affected by every other card with daybound/nightbound. Maybe it won't be too confusing in practice, but in terms of flavor maybe they could've gone all in on daybound/nightbound.

"Question for Scryfall experts here:

I have [this query]( for all cards in sets prior to 9th edition for an old-school themed deck I build (EDH). I had to choose each set individually through the Advanced Search page.   
Now, I can access that search results page directly afterwards, but I can't go back to Advanced Search view with those filters still selected. I wanted to go back and specify criterias like ""creatures that add mana of any color"" for example while keeping the same sets selected.

I know I can edit the search bar directly on the search results page (e.g. ""oracle:add oracle:mana oracle:color type:creature""), but it's a bit cumbersome, and would prefer to use the Advanced Search UI. 

**Any way to do this?** 

For example, by injecting parameters into the Advanced Search URL directly (I don't think it's supported, but I may be wrong). 

Thanks in advance

"I just started a draft in MTG Arena and have an Acererak in my deck. During one of my turns, I played Acererak and it triggered as expected - returned to my hand, ventured into the dungeon. At this point, I have still not completed a dungeon but I have enough mana to play Acererak again. I do so and Acererak returns to my hand...but I do not venture into the dungeon. I actually was able to play Acererak a third time that turn and the same thing - returned to hand, no dungeon. 

So I guess I'm wondering if this is a bug with MtG Arena or if I'm missing something in the rules. Nothing on Acererak's card indicates that his battlefield effect only triggers the first time he enters play. And I'm pretty sure you can venture more than once a turn. So I'm not sure what happened. Any suggestions/ideas? Acererak the Archlich - Once per turn?"

2. Gideon Jura with his right arm with sural raised and sunlight is shining on him.

Thanks! Where can I find Michael Komarck's art of Gideon Jura?"

"Hi, im looking for a fiew good ressources (Articles, podcasts, guides) for standard and draft with the new upcoming set. What websites do you guys use or channels even paid ones (include price plz) thats good for this kind of info. Im a daily reader so websites that update every month arent for me ^^ ty Standard/Draft articles &amp; ressources"
"Now, this isn't a post by someone who has figured this out so sorry about that. Neither is a post by someone who would know if this was attempted before but it is a post by someone who has a few slapdash ideas and wanting to know what you think.

Now I see the allied color combinations in Ravnica because they connect through the closest two points.

Azorius: order+rational= lawDimir: knowledge+selfishness=hording knowledgeRakdos: emotion+amorality=hidonisimGruul: power+nature=might makes rightSelesnya: community+harrmony=peacekeeping

Now I will be the first to say that these aren't perfect, but they are still a good place to start. so my brain instantly went to trying to find the most disconnected points for each alley color and finding a mechanic out of it.

For blue-white, I thought that the midway point between rational and community would lead to a nice ""the needs of the many out way the needs of the few"" sort of deal kind of a martyr mechanic were a creature sacrifice itself to give protection to all your other creatures. flavor-wise I would go with an ancient order of knights sworn to keep some knowledge or to protect their plan from an outside force.

For blue-black, I have a much dumber idea but it's all I could think of. this idea sort of spiraled out of black's want for satisfaction and blue's quest for knowledge and turned into a spirit tornado based on the wild hunt that each seek answers for why they stay in the mortal world. mechanically you would meet a condition then sack a creature and gain some type of advantage (life gain, card draw, damage, or countering) depending on the creature and the condition.

For red-black, this one was hard my first thought was pirates but that is already an interpretation in base magic so I had to think of something else, and since red is disorganized and black is individualistic I thought it would be best to go with by far the dumbest idea. basically, this lead me to think that it was a nice idea to make a bunch of red black creatures that either would kick off all other creatures of their type or would only allow creatures of a certain type (think necromancers).

for red-green, honestly for this combination I wasn't able to make anything I thought was good so ya...

for white-green it's the same their is no idea that feels like a streach that would also work so honestly I am stumped on these 2 , thinking about the allied colors in a different way"

I am hoping we can get everything revealed by the morning so the Limited Resources guys and other set reviewers will be able to get their common reviews going with Enough time to do rares soon so we don't have to wait until a week after drafts are on arena for the full review. Does anyone know when the full spoiler will be out? The last day for scheduled previews is over.
"Sometimes, there are cards that fit an ability word that are never assigned it, even if there's no flavor reason not to, i.e. \[\[Vinelasher Kudzu\]\] with landfall, \[\[Nightsquad Commando\]\] with raid, \[\[Arguel's Blood Fast\]\] with fateful hour, \[\[Haada Marshal\]\] with battalion, \[\[Ornery Dilophosaur\]\] with ferocious, \[\[Osai Vultures\]\] with morbid, etc. And sometimes, there are cards that have no ability wording whatsoever despite the set containing mechanical rhyming, i.e. the Rebels and Mercenaries way back in Masques Block, or &gt;!the Vampires of the new Innistrad set now!&lt;.

With this in mind, what would you label these cards with? ""Conscript"" for the old Mercenary search? ""Enduring"" for the ""Whenever you cycle or discard a card"" cards in Amonkhet? ""Trials"" for the ""put \[n\] -1/-1 counters on target creature you control"" gimmick from the same set? What Ability Words Would You Assign?"
"I'm looking to get back in the game and start playing Modern. My usual LGS is currently charging $10 for playing the FNM Constructed event (Standard/Modern). It seems the entry fee for a draft is also higher than what it was in the past at $22. For context prices at this store and other shops (Southwest US) used to be around $5 for Modern/Standard and $15 for a draft, respectively, but I was wondering whether these prices are what's typical nowadays given people are back to playing in person.

"If you play a non-creature card, (such as \[\[riddleform\]\], or a land and then \[\[living lands\]\],) that becomes a creature the turn you play it, will it have summoning sickness?

My two lines of thought are A) the permanent does not have summoning sickness, therefore if it becomes a creature, it can still attack, or B) the permanent has summoning sickness, but that rule does not apply to non-creatures; once it becomes a creature, the rule applies.

I'm looking into building my 1st commander deck, and I'd love to go for a curse deck.

any suggestions? First Commander: Curse deck"
"I don’t know about you guys and gals but I think the new wording on these transforming cards is a jumbly mess.  “When day becomes night or when night becomes day Transforming Card destroys target opponent”. 

My recommendation to WOTC is to keyword that terminology.  In my opinion it’s very obvious and is screaming to be key worded.  For example “Twilight” = day to night
And “daybreak” = night to day. 
If we had those keywords, cards could just say, “during twilight” Transform Player Killer into Nocturnal Killer. Instead of “when day turns to night…”

Or for cards that only care about a transition not the time of day, they could simply say “during daybreak or twilight, Pod Killer exiles 3 target opponents.

What do you al think? New Keywords for Midnight hunt / Crimson Vow"

"Legacy seems similar to vintage in the sense that you can use cards from all sets except for the parody sets but I heard legacy is less powerful than vintage. Does being less powerful make legacy a better format? Does being less powerful make legacy cheaper? 

I've always found legacy appealing(although super expensive) because it would allow me to use cards from all sets without being limited to just commons but apparently vintage also allows you to use cards from all sets without being limited to commons. I'm probably never going to play either of these formats but I'm asking this question because I was just curious what's actually better What's better legacy or vintage and why?"
"So a good friend of mine has been really into Magic for most of his life. He's gotten several of us into it to some extent, and we mostly play Commander.

"As the title suggests, a LGS is hosting a 4 pack sealed event with 30 CARD decks. My biggest concern is whether or not this will even be enjoyable when it's only a 30 card deck.

Curious what your guys' thoughts are on this. Is $43 Worth it to do a 4 Pack Mystery Booster Sealed?"
"Hello ~

I'm looking for prebuilt decks or such to play casualy with friends and family, like a board game.

I know there is arena starter kits decks but i'm affraid that the gameplay May be sluggish and lack of strategy due of them being adressed to teach begginners basic mexhanics

The ideal would be to have 2 or more decks that can put a good fight against each others and offer some strategical interactions, wich the starters kits and game night kit seemed to be too basic and slow paced even for casual play

Any idea ? Maybe old times duel decks ? I dont mind old decks as i dont want to play standard format 😉 What to buy for casual family play ?"

"There is a rare and an uncommon 2 color flashback cycle in MID, and normally the rares are better on average, but MID bucks this trend. Not every uncommon is better than the rare, but there are a few key ones.

[[Faithful Mending]] looks like a staple in graveyard decks whereas [[Hallowed Respite]] only has a chance for Standard play in blink decks if Standard is weak post rotation, even though there's so many strong ETBs. [[Unnatural Moonrise]] flips your werewolves, pumps your team, and gives you card draw. Whereas [[Dire Strain Rampage]] is either bad ramp or bad artifact / enchantment removal. [[Rite of Oblivion]] has a chance to be one of the top 5 BW removal spells while [[Can't Stay Away]] is just a bad [[Unearth]] that exiles your creature and the flashback costs too much to reasonably use.

Some people might be sad their rares won't have value, but the good cards being at uncommon makes the game way more affordable in both paper and Arena. I hope this trend of pushed uncommons vs ok rares continues! The Uncommon Flashback Cycle is Better than the Rare"

"Sorry I’m a bit late, haven’t had the time to go through the new clues that closely.  So the message at the very bottom will be more relevant than ever!

FAQ:

1.	**Is Gavony Dawnguard the White card that can potentially draw every turn?**  I am currently saying NO, as the card does not strictly draw.  If it turns out that the card dump doesn’t show any other cards with this effect, I’ll count it then.
2.	**Is Angelic Enforcer the other card that doubles something every turn?**  No, because that is only on YOUR turn.  I had considered it as a possibility until Unnatural Growth had been spoiled, and that card actually IS every turn.  So I’m still holding out there.

Anyway, what do we have for today?

* three popular mechanics previously seen on Innistrad return ([Flashback]( [Transform]( [Investigate](
* [a new drawback for creature tokens that lets us create them cheaper (""Decayed"", it can't block and when it attacks it is sacrificed at end of combat)](
* a white card that could potentially draw you a card each turn
* [a popular *Innistrad* card gets reprinted (Delver of Secrets)](
* [a curse that transforms into a creature (Curse of Leeches, transforms into a Leech Horror at night and can reattach to a player during the day)](
* two permanents that can double something every turn ([Unnatural Growth, the P/T of your creatures until end of turn, triggers at start of each combat](
* [a mythic cycle with ""you may pay [COST] any number of times"" (the ""Adversary"" cycle features creatures that let you spend an extra cost repeatedly as they ETB; they enter with more counters the more you spend, and have an effect that scales with them)](
* [a four mana blue aura with ""You control enchanted creature."" (Grafted Identity, you also have to sac a creature but the enchanted creature gets +1/+1)](
* [A popular tournament card in multiple formats gets reprinted with its fifth piece of art. (Pithing Needle)](
* a character from Innistrad once mentioned in a short story finally gets a card in an Innistrad set ([Liesa, Forgotten Archangel]( first mentioned (not by name) in [""A Gaze Blank and Pitiless""]( though [Ludevic, Necrogenius]( and **[Rem Karolus, Stalwart Slayer]( also count, appearing in [""Games""]( and [""Saint Traft and the Flight of Nightmares""]( respectively)
* [""If your life total would be reduced to 0 or less,"" (Enduring Angel, instead transform Enduring Angel and your life total becomes 3; if Enduring Angel doesn’t transform this way you lose the game)](
* ""This spell costs 1 less to cast for each creature you attacked with this turn.""
* [""As [CARDNAME] enters the battlefield, note your life total."" (Sigarda’s Splendor, at the beginning of your upkeep, you draw a card if your current life total is higher than the noted one, then you note again; relevant as you also gain 1 life whenever you cast a white spell)](
* [""put a slime counter on up to one other target creature."" (Sludge Monster, when it ETBs or attacks; non-Horror creatures with slime counters on them become 2/2s and lose their abilities)](
* [""Creature tokens you control lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 3/3."" (Poppet Factory, a blue artifact that transforms from a creature that makes Decayed Zombie tokens)](
* [""Each instant and sorcery card in your graveyard has"" (Lier, Disciple of the Drowned, Flashback, with cost equal to the mana cost)](

"Hi all,

With the announcement of the changes in ""The List"", I saw a lot of excitement about some cards that are being added. However, The List has some abysmal pull rates, so I did some number crunching to try to figure out how much ""value"" the list actually tends to add per set booster box. 

To do this, we need to see at what frequency each rarity drops. In the past, they have said that the cards from the list will appear at their appropriate rarities. With that information, we can conclude these cards are reprinted at the ratio of 1 Mythic : 7 Rares : 24 Uncommons : 88 Commons.

We can use this knowledge to find the pull rates of these set cards, which are:

Mythic: 0.83% 

Rare: 5.83%

Uncommon: 20%

Common: 73.33%

Now, we know there is a 25% chance for a set booster to include a card from the list. So, with 7.5 List cards per Set booster box, we can figure out how many of each card we can expect per box.

Expected number if cards per box:

Mythics: 0.0625/box

Rares: 0.4375/box

Uncommons: 1.5/box

Commons: 5.5/box

Next is calculating the EV of each slot, and multiplying it by the expected number of cards per box. The EV of the following slots are:

Mythic Rare: $11.04/card - $0.69/box

Rare: $2.32/card - $1.02/box


Uncommon: $1.54/card - $2.31/box

Common: $0.51/card - $2.82/box

So, the total added EV per box is right around $6.83 ($5+ of which is tied up in commons and uncommons). However, if you discount all the chaff (in this case, Cards &lt;$1.00) that EV drops a little lower to $5.41.

SO! When considering your Set Booster box purchase, don't let the prospect of a Snapcaster or some other juicy List card be the deciding factor. The chances of pulling The List card you want is simply abysmal, and it truly doesn't add much in terms of value to a booster box. 

Please let me know what you think and if I missed anything.

Thanks! The List and expected added value"

"As a disclaimer, I'm now talking about how they work mechanically.

I mean, how do you actually manage having a two sided card in to hand, physically?

What's the easiest way to manage that? How do you play two sided cards, such as transform?"

"Hi everyone!

Starting to collect magic and I would like to know **what's the best storage and safe storage option (I only collect, don't play):**

1. Sideloading Binder with slide outer sleeve (no ring or strap with flex cover)
2. Sideloading binder with double sleeving.
3. Double sleeving + toploaders.

Nowadays I use sideloading binder with only outer sleeve because of two main reasons:

1. I've read multiple cases of inner sleeves damaging cards borders in the long term.
2. I've also read that most of the times top loaders are an overkill vs a good binder and that most of the time, there is also a high risk putting the cards in top loaders / changing the inner sleeves of the top loaders after a few years (at the end of the day, I guess that we should change toploaders inner sleeves after a few years and by getting the card in or out of the top loader increases the risk of border damage).

Please feel free to tackle any of my assumption since I'm only a rookie!

"I want to calculate the likelihood that I will get at least one multi-colored commander if I open 12 draft boosters of Midnight Hunt.

To simplify, I assumed mythics do not exist.

I used a hypergeometric calculator:
- population size: number of rareres in the set (57)
- Sample size: number of draft booster (12)
- success in population: number of rare multicolor commanders in the set (10)
- number if successes: 1

"Hello everyone, I recently joined my school's gaming club and some people in the group including me are currently thinking about organising an initiation to mtg opened to everyone on the campus. 

We quickly came to the conclusion that the jumpstart format (2 20-cards decks which are combined to create a limited deck) was the best one as it offered an easy and diverse experience for players.

Since we are doing this with the club's money, we want the decks to be as budget as possible, easy to pick up and understand for beginners

We obviously have some themes in mind (Goblins, Elves, Black discard, Blue fliers...) But are there some sweet and unknown themes that come to your mind while fitting our conditions ? The best would be to provide a key card, like a sweet 50 cents rare which would be the showcase for the deck, the card which explains everything to a random newcomer (For example, a black deck built around sacrifice and reanimation could have \[\[Butcher of malakir\]\]) I'm trying to build my own budget beginner-friendly jumpstart format and I need your help, people of reddit !"

"I had a big break playing MTG and quit somewhere around the release of Ice Age. I came back to the game a year ago and really got into it. What I noticed though is that the sets don't feel as conclusive anymore as they used to.

I really like the worlds Wizards is creating for each new set but when it finally hits and the cards are revealed I can't really feel the vibe of the world that was presented in the set again.

Of course, this doesn't apply to every card but drafting Strixhaven for example doesn't really make me feel like I'm into this world they presented.

"With the upcoming Dimir Zombie cards from the new set, there is a combo you can do to have an undying and ever-increasing board state of zombies. For this, you need \[Wilhelt, the Rotcleaver\], \[Poppet Factory\] (transformed from Poppet Stitcher) and \[Jadar, Ghoulcaller of Nephalia\].

Assuming you have all three of these cards on the battlelfield, Jadar will keep making zombies with decayed at your endstep, but these zombies with enter the battlefield as 3/3 zombies without decayed because of Poppet Factory. If any of these 3/3 zombie tokens die, Wilhelt will replace them with a 2/2 decayed zombie which will immediately become 3/3 zombies without decayed. Thus, killing any of these zombie tokens will result in them to be replaced with another duplicate, and Jadar will keep increasing the number of tokens you have each endstep. If you're able to protect each of these combo pieces throughout the game, you will have an infinitely lasting and increasing board state of 3/3 zombie tokens which will just win you the game.

"Hello all! 

I've recently put together a Sliver deck to include [[the first sliver]] which gives all slivers cascade. The deck also includes [[Lotus Bloom]] which does not have a mana cost (suspend 3 - 0)

My question is; can I cascade into a card that has no mana cost? 

Thanks in advance! Cascade into a Lotus Bloom"
"I used to run a wolf deck with [[Waxing Moon]] and I was just curious, mechanically, how it would work with daybound/nightbound werewolves? I was thinking maybe it would transform them, their ability would trigger (if any) and then immediately transform back into their daybound form. What do you guys think? What are your thoughts on [[Waxing Moon]] in the new set?"
"So I'm making a several hour journey by bus tomorrow to a store that sells lots of magic related stuff (including older sets)

I just got a bunch of oath of the gatewatch eldrazi stuff (which I love) and am *not* looking for more gatewatch

What I'm looking to get are vampires, angels, witches, slivers, eldritch type creatures (like eldrazi, I just don't know what sets they're in besides gatewatch) and other things themed like that, especially witchy/eldritch/vampires as those are my aesthetic 

I prefer black/green/white, witchy/eldritch/vampires

"I have an old Life Matrix card from Legends which have a moderately large crimp on its upper edge.  While the card itself is not playable it is still old, RL and in good condition.

"I saw the [Prof's review]( of this item and wanted to get it for myself.

I've looked everywhere and found [this](

Off topic, but this thing has jumped in price ever since that review. But I digress. In the review, the case that the prof is reviewing has 12 compartments (while it's referred to as a 10 compartment), and the one I found has 10 (two of them are doubles). Is he reviewing a different product, or is it the same, but perhaps sold with the wrong number of compartments. If this is the case (no pun intended), does anyone know where to get the one with 12 compartments? Question about the Stanley 10-Compartment Small Parts Organizer"
"I know of a handful of cards with some humorous rules comments, such as [[Lovestruck Beast]] [[Archdemon of Paliano]] [[Liliana’s Contract]].

"In July I was stoked to get back to playing Magic (Modern) in person. I had built up a variety of decks during the pandemic (probably too many lol) and was excited to try some of them out. I didn't do to well actually playing, but I was still happy to play. 

Then I stopped taking some anxiety medication that I was on for about 2 years (long story short, I didn't think it was helping ME much and it was causing problems) and started suffering from discontinuation symptoms and a cold, so I took a break to recover. Now that I am mostly recovered, I don't feel excited about playing or collecting Magic anymore. 

I don't have any issues with the meta, but it's like my interest is suddenly gone or I had my spark snuffed out. I took a break from playing due to some health issues, now I feel disinterested"
"If I cast a spell with a kicker, does this kicker effect proc everytime I use the teleportation circle with it? For example if I cast tazeem roilmage with the kicker does this effect happen everytime I use teleportation circle on it?  Or just the initial casting of the card?  If I cast Cragplate Baloth with the kicker, if I use circle on him does he go back to a 6/6, return as a 10/10, or does he come back in as a 14/14?  Thanks for any help. Question from a newbie and teleportation circle enchantment."
"So when he enters the battlefield, the player gets an emblem that says “you may play cards exiled with Tibalt, Cosmic Imposter, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast those spells”. 

Does this mean that I can only play cards that were exiled using his planeswalker abilities? Or are cards that I exile from other spells (such as from a creature card for example) also able to be played? 

Just curious about the wording on it all, and if the exiled cards I’m able to play have to be solely from his abilities. Thanks! Question about Tibalt, Cosmic Imposter"

Bonus question, when it comes to the Eternal Night basics, do ALL of them come with the foiled pin lines, or are those what are considered the ""foil"" versions? What has the better value: Set Booster Box or Draft Booster Box?"

For example, I'm looking at playing a deck that will have \[\[glass of the guildpact\]\] in addition to \[\[goblin electromancer\]\]. Since GE reduces generic mana, GOTG would only cost one, right? GE's ability wouldn't apply to colored mana? Let's say there was a card that reduced a colored mana... would one drops that color be able to cast without paying mana?

I'm wondering if anyone else thinks it's significant that all of the creatures in the adversary cycle seem to be in the same house.

Swarm Intelligence adds a copy to the stack, but it's unlikely you'd have another target, so the second counter spell on the stack would have no target.

So, what I'm asking is, would you still get the trigger twice from something like Storm-Kiln (once from the cast, once from the copy)? Does it only care about adding casts and copies to the stack? Or does it care about said casts and copies actually resolving? Triggered effects and copying a counter spell?"
"I don’t know how to link the card fetcher so I’m just gonna write the 2 effects down but would these just constantly trigger each other

If an effect would put one or more counters on a permanent you control, it puts twice that many of those counters on that permanent instead.

Primal vigor: If one or more tokens would be created, twice that many of those tokens are created instead.
If one or more +1/+1 counters would be put on a creature, twice that many +1/+1 counters are put on that creature instead. Would doubling season and primal vigor stack infinitely?"

**Deck Overview:**

What is this deck? Well, this deck takes on 2 aspects in a sense both a snow control package with blood on the snow and planeswalkers but also takes on a dragon/turn package with multiple dragons and Alrund’s. So, it plays like both a control and dragon deck, the control part is for other control decks so that way in the late game we are not overran by their planeswalkers with the dragon part so we can end the game fast and not drag it as control decks do and try to win with card advantage. There is also a treasure package of course since most the dragons either create treasures or make treasures count for mana, the treasures help us ramp into bigger spells faster just like the snow control decks. Here though we have cards like Alrund’s or Opus to take advantage with all the mana either with the planeswalkers or with the dragons and attack them down to end the game.

So, the deck is based black of course since it is a snow control deck and the fact, we can run the treasure creature with the draw spell and planeswalkers.

**Blue:** So, what does the blue add? Well, I wanted the blue for both cards like “Divide by Zero” so that if we play against other control decks most likely will be black based Snow decks either rakdos or Orzhov having access to counter spells will be huge in that our spells will resolve no matter what but theirs will be postponed for at least a turn, it’s a tempo play card and that is what I wanted it for. It also gives us Alrund’s Ephiphany and being able to take multiple turns with either dragons or planeswalkers in play will give us massive advantage with the planeswalkers or end the game fast with the dragons.

**Red:** The red gives this deck the close out speed of the dragons like Goldspan, also gives us access to other dragons like Predator and Prismari Dragon which will either create us mana or give the deck a way to combat destroy cards with predator being able to become indestructible. But the main reason for the red in the deck is so we don’t play 30 min games and close the game out fast.

**Key Cards:**

**1. Dragons:** So the reason these are important is because of the fact they can end the game quickly especially Goldspan and Predator.  Yes we are a control type of deck but at the same time we also want to end the game quickly if you can so these help that strategy out drastically so we don't just drag the game on and on. 

**2. Card Value(Deadly Dispute/Divide by Zero):** These have some important roles in that they both get us cards either draw us cards and create a treasure with Deadly or counter a spell or bounce something on the field and get us a card from side board with Divide.  Divide and Deadly are very much tempo cards either we ramp so we can play bigger spells quicker or we slow the opponent down by countering the spell they are trying to play on the turn. 

**3. PlanesWalker:** These cards help us win the late game with card advantage, each planeswalker in the deck either is be Tibalt, Onyx or Spider Queen has an effect to gain us card advantage and we need that for the late game so that way the deck doesn't run out of cards to play.  

**Meta Game Decks:**

**Aggro:** This might be its worst match up and would only be it's worst match up if they get a very very fast start like a turn 3/4 kill on us which of course the aggro decks can do that.  There is a little support in helping them not kill us on turn 3/4 with a few creatures and divide by zero but still it will be very rough if they get that insane hand.  If that is all your running into I would recommend cutting 2 Opus and 1 Divide by Zero for some cheap removal like BloodChief or Flunk etc.... some very early cheap removal.  This should help you buy some time so that you can get to Blood on the Snow.

**Control:** This is where the deck shines against these type of decks.  Either they are some kind of black Snow control either it be Orzhov or Rakdos or even Mono Black since they have the same strategy with getting to late game with planeswalkers to win but the exception is in this deck we also run that game plan with the bonus of the blue spells.  The blue spells help against these snow control decks drastically.  Divide by Zero to counter a walker for the turn or a blood on the snow messes up their tempo, allowing the deck to be ahead of them by having our planeswalker out first.  Not to mention there is also the Dragons specifically Goldspan  which has haste and can pressure their walkers easily all while creating more mana for us to play bigger spells.  Like taking extra turns with Alrund while having some walkers in play is huge againt the black decks.  

**Midrange:** There isn't that many midrange decks that is because the Snow control decks have pretty much kept them down in the format and so this deck is no exception to that, this is a Dragon Walker Control deck.  So not only are we in the same boat as the Snow control decks but we can also end the game faster with the dragons giving us more of a heads up against this match.  Taking extra turns, countering their big spells etc... not to mention wiping their board while either brining out a planeswalker or dragon is going to be a very nice play against midrange.  

**Overall/Final Analysis:**

Overall so far I am loving this deck because it is a mix of both a dragon deck along with a control walkers deck.  It takes the best of both worlds and combines them to make an even more powerful deck.  The only thing so far I didn't like about the deck is due to it being 3 colors the mana sometimes can be problematic, and if you stumble too much on mana well of course that will end the game for you.  Other than the mana I don't see much wrong with the deck outside of maybe adding a few possible spot removal against aggro decks.  Hope you enjoy the deck if you play it.  

Also let me know if you try this deck out, love hearing feedback/improvements to the deck if you made any drop some comments down below in the video much appreciated. Hope you have fun with this deck and get some good results like I did on your quest in the arena of Magic and also remember just because I had success with the deck won’t necessarily mean everyone will either. Play a deck you are comfortable with or looks fun for you so you enjoy the game.

"My and me group of friends plan on doing an Innistrad draft next weekend, and to spice things up a bit I was considering what booster(s) would be the most fun to toss in either for fun or chaos. I was thinking of just a mystery booster initially. Most fun booster to toss into a Midnight Hunt draft?"
"Hi all, looking for a quick rules clarification. So let's say I have a card that costs 2 mana, one red and one white, and I reduce its cost to 1 through some other effect.

"Correct?
The attacking creature doesn't deal damage to the defending player after he has sacrificed the blocking creature because the attacking creature is still considered blocked? Defending player can declare blockers and then sacrifice a defending creature before the damage assignment without having suffered any damage dealt by the attacking creature to the player"

"Hi new to mtg and i don't know if this is a common question or not but does a creature with deathtouch that deals damage to a creature with ward need to pay the ward cost?

Ik ward says it triggers on a spell or ability the player controls and deathtouch is a static ability but used on a creature controlled by the player so idk how to rule it tbh.

Any guidance would be appreciated.

"I don't know if this has been asked before but is pauper affinity a good enough deck to attempt to convert to modern? I understand a good chunk of cards are not modern legal (disciple, artifact lands, hydro/pyroblast, reaping the graves) but does the deck seem like it would be good enough with like thought monitor, urza's saga, treasure vault, etc? I currently play Death's Shadow and kinda wanted a change of pace, especially since my salamander was slain in pauper. I'll take any thoughts or opinions, don't Hurkyl's Recall me bro.

"I'm new to Magic and I'm not quite sure how exactly blocking works (how many blockers can block how many attackers, how is damage dealt between them etc.).

I made a picture of an example situation and a bunch of keywords on the cards:



You can assume the defender has enough mana to cast the instant. The attacker attacks with all creatures. I wouldn't be able to play it out properly, so how would the situation play out if the attack was defended optimally? And what things should I remember in general when I attack or defend?

Thanks in advance. I don't exactly know how blocking works, any help? (example picture included)"
"Greetings all, just wanted to start a discussion about decks that will rise to power post-rotation.

I currently think that some sort of Jeskai deck will come to fruition. Considering that we have one of the best creatures ever printed available to us, Delver of Secrets would be the core of the deck. From there, I think blue and white add the most potency. Rem Karolus, Stalwart Slayer seems very powerful alongside Play with Fire and Magic Missile. Expressive Iteration is an extremely powerful card, and Faithful Mending seems like it has potential. All of these could give Poppet Stitcher and Bloodthirsty Adversary a home.

The list could look something like this:

4 Delver of Secrets

4 Bloodthirsty Adversary

2 - 3 Rem Karolus, Stalwart Slayer

2 - 3 Poppet Stitcher // Poppet Factory

4 Thunderous Rebuke

4 Play with Fire

4 Expressive Iteration

2 - 3 Magic Missile

2 - 3 Sacred Fire

2 - 3 Faithful Mending

2 - 3 Teferi, Who Slows the Sunset

This obviously is a brew, nothing is concrete as the format may change completely and have no place for this deck but I feel like either this build or a Grixis variant that utilizes Infernal Price and Power Word Kill will become popular.

"Well, a lot of clues have been updated overnight, what with all the Legendaries that have been flying in.  We’re starting to see a lot of them fill up!

While I’m here though, I will be discussing two common FAQs:

1.	**Is Gavony Dawnguard the White card that can potentially draw every turn?**  I am currently saying NO, as the card does not strictly draw.  If it turns out that the card dump doesn’t show any other cards with this effect, I’ll count it then.
2.	**Is Angelic Enforcer the other card that doubles something every turn?**  No, because that is only on YOUR turn.  I had considered it as a possibility before Unnatural Growth was spoiled, and that card actually IS ever turn.  So I’m still holding out there.

Now that that is all set, let’s move on to today’s clues!

MaRo’s List:  

* three popular mechanics previously seen on Innistrad return ([Flashback]( [Transform]( [Investigate](
* [a new drawback for creature tokens that lets us create them cheaper (""Decayed"", it can't block and when it attacks it is sacrificed at end of combat)](
* a white card that could potentially draw you a card each turn
* [a popular *Innistrad* card gets reprinted (Delver of Secrets)](
* [a curse that transforms into a creature (Curse of Leeches, transforms into a Leech Horror at night and can reattach to a player during the day)](
* two permanents that can double something every turn ([Unnatural Growth, the P/T of your creatures until end of turn, triggers at start of each combat](
* [a mythic cycle with “you may pay [COST] any number of times” (the “Adversary” cycle features creatures that let you spend an extra cost repeatedly as they ETB; they enter with more counters the more you spend, and have an effect that scales with them)](
* [a four mana blue aura with “You control enchanted creature.” (Grafted Identity, you also have to sac a creature but the enchanted creature gets +1/+1)](
* [A popular tournament card in multiple formats gets reprinted with its fifth piece of art. (Pithing Needle)](
* [a character from Innistrad once mentioned in a short story finally gets a card in an Innistrad set (Liesa, Forgotten Archangel, first mentioned (not by name) in]( [“A Gaze Blank and Pitiless”](
* [""If your life total would be reduced to 0 or less,"" (Enduring Angel, instead transform Enduring Angel and your life total becomes 3; if Enduring Angel doesn’t transform this way you lose the game)](
* ""This spell costs 1 less to cast for each creature you attacked with this turn.""
* **[""As [CARDNAME] enters the battlefield, note your life total."" (Sigarda’s Splendor, at the beginning of your upkeep, you draw a card if your current life total is higher than the noted one, then you note again; relevant as you also gain 1 life whenever you cast a white spell)](
* [""put a slime counter on up to one other target creature."" (Sludge Monster, when it ETBs or attacks; non-Horror creatures with slime counters on them become 2/2s and lose their abilities)](
* [""Creature tokens you control lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 3/3."" (Poppet Factory, a blue artifact that transforms from a creature that makes Decayed Zombie tokens)](
* **[""Each instant and sorcery card in your graveyard has"" (Lier, Disciple of the Drowned, Flashback, with cost equal to the mana cost)](
* **[""Instants and sorcery spells you cast cost X less to cast, where X is [CARDNAME]’s power."" (Vadrik, Astral Archmage, he gets a +1/+1 counter every time day turns to night and vice versa)](
* [""put that many +1/+1 counters on [CARDNAME], then create twice that many 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens"" (Tainted Adversary, the Black Adversary)](
* ""At the beginning of your end step, if you have exactly 13 life,""
* [""You may cast any number of the copies without paying their mana costs."" (Bloodthirsty Adversary, the Red Adversary exiles instants and sorceries with mana value 3 or less from your graveyard and copies them)](

"So this was a discussion yesterday and I wanted clarity.
If a creature of enchantment prevents a creature to untap during its next untap step they would still be able to untap it on their third turn correct?

•Example 

Attack- tap
Next turn- tapped
3rd turn- can untap

Or does it stay tapped whole game? Doesnt untap during the next untap step"
"Not sure if it's possible to know ahead of time, but I thought I'd ask Is there any chance we'll get a Thalia card?"
"I’m just curious if force of savagery, the 8/0 creature would put 8 counters in kresh, who says “when a creature is put into a graveyard from play he gets counters equal to that creatures power” so does force of savagery resolve? Or if never enters play due to 0 toughness Does force of savagery give kresh 8 +1 counters?"

"I’m building my first Obeka, Brute Chronologist deck and I have a question about how two cards would interact. If I played Sudden Spoiling to make all target player’s creatures lose all abilities and have base P/T of 0/2 until end of turn, would tapping Obeka mean that the opponent’s creatures would remain 0/2 even after the turn was over? Obeka and Sudden Spoiling Combo?"
"Following my previous analyses (my latest was Strixhaven [ I went through WotC's ""explanations"" of what is in Midnight Hunt's Draft &amp; Set boosters, trying to figure out what changed and what we'll find in a box of these. 

While WotC was quite forthright about percentages of each slot with the launch of Set boosters for Zendikar Rising, following sets have had less and less precise breakdowns and more confusing infographics. Given how much the contents of Set boosters change and shift around (while price remains pretty much the same) I feel it's important to break down these products.

The first observation is that not much has changed overall for Draft boosters - the new thing is one guaranteed double-face common, and one guaranteed double-face uncommon or rare in each pack (this does not impact rarity breakdown). Every Draft and Set booster has a full-art, Eternal Night basic land so that's cool. Draft boxes are the same as usual (and no extra slots like Strixhaven...)

For Set boosters, things have changed a bit: first of all, there's now a fixed floor of Commons and Uncommons (3C, 2U), to which you have to add 2 ""wildcard"" CU slots (I assume these to be 50/50, but reality might be closer to 70/30). This is a change from the previous ""1 to 5 uncommons"" model. Then there is the usual rare/mythic slot and the CURM foil slot, with the addition of two wildcard CURM slots (again, distribution of rarities for these slots hasn't been revealed). 

After running some math, here's a breakdown by BOX:

* Overall, Set boxes contain much less common chaff - 190 cards vs. the 320 of Draft booster boxes
* Set and Draft booster boxes contain THE SAME amount of Uncommon (110), Rare (32) and Mythic (5) cards
* Set boxes contain more foils - obviously, a guaranteed one in each pack, while Draft boxes have 1 in 3 packs
* Both products contain a full-art showcase land, but in Set boxes you get only 30, while Draft ones have 36
* Set boosters contain cards from the List, so on average 5C, 2U and 1R/M from the numbers above come from this pool of cards
* Set boosters *seem* to offer more chances to pull showcase frame cards, but this isn't very clear and might be actually similar percentages to Draft boosters this time

So, to summarize: Set boosters were introduced at a higher price to cater to people who prefer cracking packs, with the lure of less chaff / more rares. With Strixhaven, Mystical Archives and Lessons did actually skew things in favor of Draft boxes, which according to my numbers had slightly more rares and mythics. Now, Midnight Hunt seems to have brought these two products **extremely** close in terms of contents - only Set boosters have 1/3 less commons and cost more. 

Now, same caveats: the numbers above are AVERAGES. There are going to be more lucky and less lucky boxes, and there's going to be outliers. Also, WotC doesn't reveal the official slot-by-slot percentages anymore (to my knowledge), so I have to calculate Wildcard slots according to the usual CURM rarity distribution of draft packs. WotC claims that ""27% of Set boosters contain 2 rares or mythics"", and this according to my numbers is actually 24% - but this is likely reflecting that the Wildcard slots have actually slightly higher chances of containing a rare or mythic card - anyway, we are talking about a small difference of 36,6 vs 38 rares&amp;mythics per box.

In conclusion: I wish I didn't have to do this, also because it necessarily rests on some assumptions and missing data. If you have any data that I'm missing, especially about Wildcard slots, let me know. I wish WotC disclosed the actual structure of their products so that us consumers could evaluate if it's worth paying the markup of a Set box for, essentially, the same contents we'd get from Draft boxes (barred List cards and more foils, of course). Instead, we get lootbox-like breakdowns that make the difference in price opaque and leave consumers to their gut feelings. Midnight Hunt Set vs Draft boosters"
"I am relatively new to Magic, and have been loving it so far playing with my friends (who are also new like myself). My biggest issue I have found so far is I get attached to my cards, and it makes it very difficult to decide what cards to remove to add new ones. Myself, nor my friends really know enough on what to remove yet, so I am hoping for some advice from some more experienced players. I have already went through and replaced a lot, now I am stuck on how to move forward.

"I'm really excited to attend my first LGS event, but admittedly I'm also nervous. I haven't had much paper experience and have mostly been playing on Arena. What should I expect from a prerelease event? Any tips for a new player?

"The way the day/night token and other transformation references are written its pretty ambiguous as to when the transformation is actually triggered.

"I was just pondering some ideas on what reprints we might see in the Commander Decks. There are a lot of good old cards that could shine in both decks that are long overdue for reprints. As for zombies, I've had my eye on [[Gravespawn Sovereign]], as it is a Zombie that lets you get some extra utility out of all those Decayed Zombie tokens you'll be making! [[Endless Ranks of the Dead]] would be another excellent reprint, however I think the price tag might be a little too high. Who knows though. [[Rot Hulk]] is a card that has only seen one printing and would fit perfectly in this list.

Hey all¡¡¡ Recently i made a post about starting to play commander. Now is the turn for standard.

Im a new player and im considering my first purchases and i dont know more aboutt MTG than what i have played in Arena for learning the basics.

What product do you think will give me the best balance between fun and quality to start playing? I dont care about value of the cards, cause i dont have plans to sell anyway.

I have several options and i cant decide for one, or maybe you have a better option for me:

\- Jumpstart boosters.

\- Planeswalker decks.

\- Ravnica Guild kits.

\- Challenger decks.

\- 2 last MTG Arena starter packs.

\- Bundles or boosters like the new Innistrad collection.

Thank you all for your help and suggestions, all your opinions are welcome. Help with first products. (Standard or modern). Fully newbie."

"Angels are my favorite creatures and I like building 100% angel decks (so no things like Heliod, Sun Crowned. Literally just angels, resurrection cards, and removal).

So it got me thinking that Cavern of Souls is the number one reprint I'd like to see.

But then I remembered the top decks in the format as of standard 2022 are...ones that love playing dragons and goblins and the like and not more niche ones like angels. (I know their is a strong deck that uses angels but it also uses non angel creatures as well because it wants to be competitive)

I was curious if you all thought it would be to strong for 2022 to have such a land in standard considering how strong dragons and goblins are right now. Would Cavern of Souls be to strong for this standard?"
I didn’t play during original Innistrad. I have seen everyone mentioning that transforming or Day Night has now been fixed with the new implementation in Midnight Hunt. Can someone please explain ? Thanks What is meant by Day / Night being “fixed” relative to original Innistrad?
"Lorwyn, like many Magic planes, suffered from being ""fixed"" at the end of the block. Its most interesting feature, The Great Aurora, was reversed and the day and night cycle returned to normalcy. 

This made return to Lorwyn awkward. Returning to Lorwyn without Aurora would be disappointing and re-creating the Aurora would be lazy.

This is why the new mechanic from Innistrad is the perfect solution to this problem. The Daybound side would represent Lorwyn and Nighbound side Shadowmoor. It's so fitting, it basically writes itself!

There's but one problem with this: Innistrad itself. If the mechanic does well, WOTC would use it in any future Innistrad sets and may not be willing to share it with an old plane like Lorwyn. If the mechanic does poorly, then we definitely won't see it herald Lorwyn's return.

What does the community think of this idea? Would you like to return to Lorwyn in this fashion? The Daybound/Nightbound mechanic is the perfect solution for return to Lorwyn."

"So, since i saw the new take on the greatest mind of Innistrad, i obviously couldn't be sadder with not only his fate but also the color/mechanic choice.

When i said my opinion, one of my friends awnsered ""At least he's in the right colors now"", and that threw me off a lot. I know some people didn't like [[Ludevic, Necroalchemist]] for the lack of black mana (that honestly could've been taken care by making [[Kraum]] a UB zombie, but whatever), but is the greatest amount of the disdain because he was UR?

If that is the case i'm legitmally shocked, because while indeed he makes skaabs, he's mainly a Necroalchemist, something that througly has been stated to be different from Stitchers (like Geralf), even though they sometimes adopt their techniques. And even many of the flavor text that made reference to him before his first card iteration was fully UR, much like many other ""scientists"" of the plane. So i felt like making this post to express my confusion on the ""Ludevic controvesy"" as well as discuss the topic.

PS: Sorry if the tag is wrong, but this is the one that felt the best with the topic of the post i wanted to make. Ludevic's color identity and the reception of his cards"
"Long story short. Took a hiatus from LGS activity and managing my trade binder. My casual play group doesn't engage in much trading, typically.

"I feel like 35% of games have a guaranteed winner, where as 65% of games are ""live"". 

While this is contextual based on format, I'm more interested in a rough guess from everyone.

To explain further:

* Imagine a game of magic between two players, 60 (or 40) cards per deck.
* At the end of a game, you can see how each player had a specific series of cards to work with (typically only a percentage of the entire deck).
* Given two average but competent players, how often will the game:
   * Be decided on this two series of cards. There was no way how if both players played competently, the winner could lose, or the loser could win. *Versus*:
   * Be decided on one or more crucial decisions played. In other words, both players had a reasonable opportunity to win the game.

For myself (having played for over 20 years), I would guess a 35/65 split. Much of this 35% is due to mana screw or flood, or having a strong sequence of cards on one side, unable to be answered by a weak sequence of cards on the other.

Thoughts? What Percentage of MTG Games was the Winner Guaranteed to Win?"

I was searching for Innistrad Lore and found someone from Creative's comment that Elves existed in Innistrad and then went extinct. Does this ""Lore"" still exist? Or was it just a joke? Elves on Innistrad?"
"Quoted from second paragraph of [article from IGN](

&amp;#x200B;

* It's likely to there's a rare cycle of 5 colors - include the W and U cameo, with G unknown;
* 2 more B werewolf, one spoiled and one unknown, as [Making-Magic]( said total of 3 in B;
* Tovolar and uncommon RG signpost, each color pair seems to get only one ;
* The adversary mythic cycle featured other four tribes with G open right now, though they might avoid TDFC for the cycle, I tend to believe WW will fit in as there's no mythic WW here yet, and Wrenn / Ooze already took two mono-G slots.

Adding the 4R and 1G below rare, we currenly have 12 spoiled (Arlinn's probably excluded from creature). As from the past sets R and G split the amount evenly and according to the [showcase number crunch]( we have 1B (291) 1R (slot 293) and 5G (2 from cycle above, 3 below rare, filling the rest 5 slots in crunch). However, for 309 warlocks (WG) already got uncommon and there might not be a complete dual cycle at rare, potentially there could be another multi-colored WW.

"The recent set has brought to light the tautology of keywords. If every keyword has to be explained in addition to writing the keyword - what's the intention of actually making the ability a keyword? (Some higher rarities I know emit the reminder text) 
I get it's done to 'save space' and create a term for reference for the ability but referencing it on almost every card seems counter intuitive.

Seems odd to create Daybound/Nightbound but not a term for the transition between. Hence cards like [[The Celetus]] are a mess of the words night and day. 

An interesting solution would be to (like they are doing now for draft archetypes) have a tokens with a backside that defines all the keywords.

Thoughts? Tautology of Keywords"
"So here's the situation, last year I was just getting back into MTG after not playing for a few years. I was playing arena mostly but was looking for a more social way to play so I ended up playing on tabletop sim with a woman from a gaming group I was in at the time. I told her that I was getting back into the game but I was still coming up to speed.

The first time we played it was fine, I played against her modern werewolves deck and she lent me an EDH deck of hers so we could play some 1v1 commander. The second time was very different, she played this awful dredge deck with basically no interaction and turns that went on super long (I tend to call it a solitaire deck). It was a really frustrating experience to deal with for the second time I played with this person and being newly back into the game itself. Afterwards she said she had played that deck just to mess with me and I honestly thought about just quitting again.

So I guess my question is, does this situation sound like gatekeeping? It really feels like it was from my perspective. Question about gatekeeping"
"With the release of \[\[Falkenrath Perferator\]\] I have lore and mechanics hopes for VOW. If Anje's planning to crash the wedding it might explain what we're seeing in vampires now.

In another discussion I'd had, someone mentioned that Madness only worked last block because of the Eldrazi. But by lore, Anje's teaming up all the vampires affected by Emrakul's influence. Emrakul's also still around but imprisoned and we know from Zendikar that Ulamog created the Bloodchiefs. Emrakul's now imprisoned in the moon, she can influence vampires like Ulamog did.

I think like Midnight Hunt with certain werewolves siding with humans against the dire pack, Olivia is uniting with the Markov bloodline (Sorin probably in this scenario) to organize and police vampires so they don't drink all the humans and kill themselves in the process, replacing Avacyn in that role. Anje and the Falkenraths, pushed by Emrakul, crash the wedding in an attempt to wreck the alliance and keep the vampires as bloodthirsty maniacs.

This could explain why we're seeing discard outlets for Madness and ping face damage for Spectacle. On one side, we have the Falkenrath madness vampires, probably in Rakdos, maybe even Grixis. On the other side we have Mardu, Orzhov... Maybe even Boros vampires with spectacle? We don't have any Boros vampires yet, just the three Mardu ones who are all commanders and would just love some vampires in the unrepresented colour pair.

Do I have something here or am I way off base? I'd be interested to hear what others hope for in VOW.

TL;DR Anje crashing Olivia's wedding could be how we're getting Madness and Spectacle in the next set. Rampant VOW Speculation"
Just curious given she's interacting with the Gatewatch. Is Oath of Arlinn crunched out?
"I haven't find anything online so maybe I'll find my answer here !

The new set will introduce the Nightbound/Daybound mechanics, stating that double-faced cards in the set will be flipped when it becomes day or night etc....

My question is : Will this apply to every double-faced card with a sun/moon in their upper left corner (cards from previous inistrad set, or cards from the new with no mention of the day/nightbound keyword in their text), or will it be restricted to cards with the keyword in their rules text ? 

If the first case applies, this makes for a great expansion to make a day/nightbound themed deck 😀 Day/nightbound mechanic with previous cards ??"

"Hey folks,

TLDR: Make pre con voltron deck go fast and fun to play with friends for littleish money.  [List!](

I've recently gotten back into playing paper magic after about ten years of not owning any cards.  Some old friends moved back into town and the old crew from college has gotten back together to pretend it's 2012 again.  It's been an absolute blast.  We have been playing commander pretty much exclusively and I really think it's the best way to play the game with friends.  I have played a lot of Arena (mostly limited) since it first came out and it has gotten pretty stale, but has helped keep me fresh on the rules, phases of the game, managing a curve, evaluating cards etc.

I purchased some of the precon commander decks to play along with my friends and overall have been pretty happy with what came out of the box.  I even have the most wins (only by 1) at the table since we started keeping track.   However, my friends never stopped collecting cards, and I donated all of mine when we moved apart a decade ago.  Many of their decks are just piles of mythic rares, like five color good stuff from [[prismatic bridge]], one-shot infect with [[Minsc, beloved ranger]], and [[Kaalia of the Vast]] gets two combat phases.  It feels like most games I don't participate much until the very end since everyone else can throw threats at the board and I have to save mine plus a board wipe.

I've been putting together an upgrade package to the Aura of Courage pre con deck with hopes of upping the power level a bit so that I can be a little more threatening and have a chance to attack earlier in the game.  I’m hoping to resolve Galea on turn 3 or 4 and then be able to start suiting her up. I feel like it's really important to protect her early since she is my only real threat and form of defense.  Hexproof and indestructible feel almost necessary, and perhaps some form of protection that I am currently without.  I would like to have her start attacking on turn 5 to 7 and continuously power her up until she can 1v3 the entire board alone with threats like [[kaldra compleat]], [[worldslayer]], [[Finest Hour]], etc.  I have a few board wipes that I feel fit very thematically like [[single combat]] to help control things, and a few ways to recur my weapons if they should get knocked off [[bruna, light of alabaster]].

  I'm new to deck building for this format and would really appreciate having a few extra sets of eyes on my pile before I submit my order for singles online. I know that playing voltron isn’t the best strategy but I have had a lot of fun playing it.  I am trying to keep the budget low and avoiding obvious power houses in the theme like [[stoneforge mystic]] or [darksteel plate]].  My main concern with the current state of the list is that I will not be able to resolve enough threats onto Galea to make the deck fun to play.  I have some ways to manipulate the top of my deck but without them I could run out of gas quickly.  Do I need more pieces for Galea, more ways to control the top of the deck, or reliable and early card draw?  How does my curve look?  Is it too low the ground so that I might run out steam as the game stretches on?  Do I have too many tutors in place so that I won’t be using them for finding situational bombs like Bruna, and instead take turns off to fetch something like [[champion’s helm]].  Any other thoughts or ideas would be appreciated.  

Also I’m sorry if this is the wrong place for this post.  I’m just so excited to be playing magic again. EDH deck building"
"They phrase the Daybound / Nightbound mechanic as such: 

 Daybound *(If a player cast no spells during their own turn, it becomes night next turn.)* 

 Nightbound *(If a player cast at least two spells during their own turn, it becomes day next turn.)* 

I'm guessing this is a noob question because the old werewolf cards seem to work the same but I just started playing at Kaldheim and I'm not sure what is considered ''spells'' in this case.

Would it only be Sorcery and Instant cards or does it include artifacts, creatures, enchants etc. since all cards are technically ''spells''.

"Basically a follow up to an earlier question.

I wondered what kind of obscure creature type would make an interesting planewalker, then it clicked. The Multiverse is lousy with Genius Loci that have wills and spirits of their own. So what's stopping one from jumping ship to a nicer neighborhood when other planeswalkers show up to ruin their shit?

A sapient city that reconfigures its appearance and layout chameleonically to blend into the local environment so it can assimilate the local culture? A mountain with a living crystal core that erupts with light rather than heat that finds tribal communities to educate and tutor? An acquisitive ocean that encircles things is considers worthy of protection.

Point being theres a lot of shit you could do with the concept (especially considering how ridiculous a lot of lands are at this point). If lands can be sapient... why can't they planeswalk?"

"I’ve proactively added hate cards to my decks in order to combat that card but it’s no use. The fact that now they can cascade into it with the greatest of ease and not risk hitting a 0 mana card is absurd. Why is this shitty card still legal?

"The flavour text of cards on Midnight Hunt has several references to the Moon. Last time we were on Innistrad our favourite spaghetti monster got sent to the Moon, we are now seeing the effects of it first-hand. 

My question is how many years have passed on Innistrad since the events of Shadows over Innistrad? How much time has passed on Innistrad since Emrakul got imprissoned in the moon?"
"“Aha! Yes! Now I hear it, the beautiful poetry of the lights in the sky.” 

So as a human delver couldnt hear this, but suspected somehow there would be a signal he could pick up as a insect creature thing. 
His shock

“Aha! Yes!” 

The question is since the humans arnt hearing her whispers anymore, this noise must be emrakul speaking to some entities on a secret frequency or something; and while delver hears it, he wants to go to the moon directly and ask.
(Also could be entities looking for her but she’s asleep)

“I must reach the moon and ask what it all means!” 
(Either she’s awake and can maybe explain, or she’s asleep but missing phone calls in a sense) 

He knows that emrakul must have the answers because she’s facilitating the conversations, she’s communicating as it were with said noises; or at the very least delver knows they are intended for her. 
(That’s why he assumes she’s got the answers)

To humans she’s asleep, delver with his new bug powers and can pick up that secret frequency and realizes there’s something afoot; and wants to go ask. 

JUST A THEORY, but that’s some INSANELY odd flavor text to be baseless. 

What would emrakul be communicating with? Eldrazi / other beings communicating that sounds like poetry maybe? 
If she’s not asleep what is she waiting for. 

If she is asleep why does delver make the connection of-
“Weird sounds in the sky/space” than
“ID BETTER GO ASK THE MOON”

I’m with delver on this one! I wanna know what it means. 

no way that’s wasted flavor, curious of your guys thoughts; put this together cause I normally read flavor texts and it stuck out because I saw the card [[imprisoned in the moon]] years back now I read delivers flip side. (Theory) Insectile aberration flavor text implication (tin foil time)"
"Hey so I'm fairly new to magic compared to how expansive the game has become since I started played when the newer theros set came out after eldraine and thus for 1: have only ever known eldraine era magic, and 2: have no idea about any of the cards that came before except a little bit in the ravnica/war block that rotated out. 

My plan was that its already too late for me to go back and learn the old cards and I should just focus on standard and learning the new cards that come out since then but innistrad has got me excited and interested in old innistrad and others like it. I have a couple commander decks but ones barely upgraded from the precon and the other is literally still just the silver quill precon that came out this year.

What I'm looking for here is maybe if someone knows the most efficient way to go back and learn the historic cards without wasting my time on the thousands of filler cards that I don't need to know about anyway that can hopefully get me started on learning to play historic and actually give me knowledge of good cards I should have for my commander decks cause I could always just look up upgrade guides or decklists but I want to be able to recognize and know what I'm looking for in perfecting my own.

Hopefully there's a source out there or a YouTube channel or podcast or something that can teach me what I'm missing, but short of going through and reading every single card that's come out I don't know how to find what I'm looking for. If you read all this and know how to help then thanks &lt;3 Learning Historic"

"I'm always hearing about people drafting / playing EDH or Cubes with friends, and honestly I'm quite jealous. I've moved around a lot in my life (states and countries), so I never managed to have more than a couple friends locally. However, I used to travel all the time for my job and made several friends whom I'd meet up with multiple times a year, which was fine for me.

However, since Covid, the traveling and meet-up events have stopped, my friends groups have become fractured, and I've changed industries. This has left me with virtually 0 face-to-face friend interaction for almost 2 years now.

Recently, I moved to a city where I plan to live for at least the next 5-10 years, so I've tried attending multiple LGS in hopes of making real friends again. Things haven't been exactly great on that front. Almost everyone has been friendly and considerate during matches, but it seems like there's a new group of people every time I go. I engage in banter, discuss cards, recent sets, anything that seems relevant but it usually stops there.

So do people actually make friends with the people at their LGS, or are these groups I want to be a part of only exist from organic creation from high school / work and people just go to LGS for competitive play / quick drop-in matches? How Does Someone make Actual Friends at an LGS?"
"Hi all,

I bought a box of Throne of Eldraine, Modern Horizons 2, and Commander legends on TCGPlayer (all from different stores).

I received all of them and looking at my MH2 box the plastic wrap seems weird especially when compared to the other boxes.
1.) The logo on the plastic wrap doesn't have the copyright symbol in the lower right
2.) There is a ""shadow"" on each and every logo on the wrap
3.) Both ends are _heavily_ sealed with a lot of excess it seems
4.) The logo rubs of really easily with your finger and light pressure
5.) the wrap is pretty loose

Here are some pics. There is one included of my Commander legends draft booster box with the logo to showcase the difference in quality and the lack of copy right symbol.

 Help determining if this box has been resealed/tampered with"
"He breathed heavily while trying to dug himself out of the mountain of corpses he was underneath. Another night, another battle, another victory, another wound on his already messed up body. Odric then spit up what appeared to be some viscous green liquid, probably from one of the corpses. “Just perfect. With my luck, I’d probably turn into some undead freak or a monster toad or something,” he thought. Astrid, a young woman with pale skin and dark hair approached the marshal.


“Are you alright, Sir?”


“I think I’m fine. How many?”


“We lost five.”


“Five… so we lost half our forces. Sigarda protect us…”


Odric then gathered up his remaining cathars. One of them, a young man from Thraben named Rasmund, lost three fingers from his left hand while Walda had her left ear torn off. 


“See to your wounds.” He then turned towards Astrid. “You too, Astrid.”


“I’m fine.”


“You’re not fine. None of us are fine. We need to heal and regroup. Nine miles until Havengul. Who knows what monstrosities we’ll encounter?”


“Hopefully, not another zombie horde,” said Heinrich, the youngest in Odric’s group. Only 16, the teen was a promising warrior but, like many boys his age, he was immature and prone to rash decisions. The marshal would never have taken Heinrich with him but these were unusual times. “I could use a rest.”


“You could use more brain in your head,” said Odric. “What was that charge? That aberration almost cut off your head. You lunged at it with just your dagger. Did you want to join your fallen comrades in death?”


“No… that big monster killed Petra.”


“And you wanted to avenge her by dying? Listen, I know you were sweet on her, I am not blind. However, your duty is not only to her but to every human on Innistrad. Five comrades of ours died tonight, sacrificing their lives so that little village we passed through a while ago may be safe tonight. That horde was going there, I can assure you. The only thing you can do for Petra now is to bury her deep. May her soul be granted the peace of the Blessed Sleep.”


Heinrich’s eyes were in tears but the boy saw to his task. After the dead were buried and prayers were said, the five remaining cathars started their perilous trek towards Havengul.


“Listen up. As we approach the sea, we’ll inevitably be surrounded by the Nebelgast. As you can see, it already started. From now on, we’ll hold hands. Don’t approach any light or be fooled by any sound. Once, a geist tried to fool me by masquerading his voice into that of a child in need.”


“I thought the Nebelgast is only around Selhoff.”


“No, Astrid. True, it’s at its strongest in Selhoff, but Drunau and Havengul has its share of it. Now, let’s be quiet, we don’t want to draw out the geists.”


The fog was getting thicker and thicker and Odric could barely see in front of him. He held Astrid’s and Heinrich’s hands while the two held the other two’s hands. Suddenly, the marshal heard moaning. He then whispered: “Don’t make any sudden move. There are geists here.”


The moaning then turned into gurgling which then turned into slurping. “You fooled my ears but my nose is as sharp as ever. UNDEAD! BATTLE FORMATION!”


They left each other’s hands and drew out their swords,. Astrid set her blade aflame while Heinrich and Rasmund started chanting. Walda already activated her wards. Odric was the first to see the zombies approaching.


“SIGARDA,” he shouted, “SEND YOUR BLESSINGS TO US! OUR BREATHS GIVE LIFE TO OUR PRAYERS AND YOUR BENEVOLENCE GIVES STRENGTH TO OUR ARMS! CATHARS, LET’S CLEANSE THE UNDEAD FILTH!”


HALF AN HOUR LATER

He dug himself out again, mouth full of horrendous liquids that made him retch. This time, there was no Astrid to talk to him. She was shambling, alongside the other cathars, in the remaining horde. A weaker man than Odric would have caved in and accepted his fate but Odric was no weak man. “SIGARDA,” he cried again, “HEAR MY PRAYERS! GIVE STRENGTH TO MY ARM AND FIRE TO MY HEART. GIVE ME THE MEANS TO PURGE THE UNDEAD HORDE!” He then glanced at the horde and saw the ghoulcaller that raised it approach him.


“You…”


“Me, me, tiny little me,” said Gisa in a cheerful voice. “Long time no see.”


“Is this horde your payback because I captured you, witch?”


“Oh please, I am above such petty feelings like revenge. Or am I? In any case, I had no intention of fighting you. You were in the way.”


“What do you want, ghoulcaller?”


“Well, I heard from a winemaker in Videns that my beloved cousin Mikaeus might be in Nephalia. Now, I’m not sure is him but that man described him as a “powerful undead who destroyed an entire village in Nephalia. Who else can be? Oh… maybe it’s that horrible creation of my brother… Grimgrin!”


“You are insane. Your brother killed our Lunarch and you defiled his body with necromancy. Do you want to piss on it too?”


“Oh, goodness, that mouth on you! Mikaeus’s raising wasn’t my doing. There are other ghoulcallers on Innistrad. Besides, were I the one to raise him, I wouldn’t have lost him. Think, please, Odric?”


Not even when that werewolf killed his son wasn’t Odric as angry as now. He then climbed on the mountain of corpses he was under just a while ago and felt his body filling with light and power. “Thank you, Sigarda! GHOULCALLER,” he shouted. “I AM TIRED OF YOUR SHIT!” Odric is Tired of Your Shit fanfiction (enjoy!)"

"Recently, I've been pretty down on Magic's art. While it is extremely well-done technically, I have a lot of trouble distinguishing most artists from one another. Of course you have your standouts like Seb McKinnon, but the vast majority of art looks and feels nearly identical. The art especially seems to lack a sense of grit, I would say; look at the differences between the four versions of \[\[Phyrexian Arena\]\]. The oldest two both have a very dirty feel to them, like you're within the arena watching the horrors unfold. The newer two (especially Commander Collection Black's version) lack this feeling, very clean and tidy. 

This issue has only been exacerbated by Innistrad Midnight Hunt, at least so far. All you really have to do is look between the two versions of \[\[Delver of Secrets\]\] to see the crux of the issue. Original Delver is very odd and disturbing, while new delver is almost cutesy, in a way. So far, I'd say the only actually scary card in the set is \[\[Fleshtaker\]\]. due to the unique style that was allowed for the art. Pretty much all of the other cards have the exact same feel as we've got over the past few years.

I guess what I'm saying is that I feel that Magic's art has become immensely homogenized over the past half-decade, and I can hardly remember any of it, when the art was one of the things that drew me in in the first place. If you disagree, please feel free to explain why in the comments. Thoughts on recent/present art?"
"...and Arcane Signet for Brawl once Standard rotates?

These are key cards for Standard Brawl so it feels like they should stick around, but without a reprint (or other intervention from Wizards) we will lose them. So has anyone heard anything about these cards? Is Wizards going to ""reprint"" them in an Arena set, or bring out some new Brawl precons that include them? Do we know what's happening with Command Tower..."
"I've got some friends wondering about a possible Cavern of Souls reprint, as unlikely as it is. Looking at the numbers we've seen, it's still technically possible with it showing up at numbers 258 or 259.

So, is there anything else that rules out Cavern of Souls? Do we know all mythics/lands in the set? I know there are some mythics not yet revealed but we know they'll finish cycles seen. Has anyone from WotC confirmed it will not be reprinted or maybe saved for Crimson Vow boxtoppers? Can we rule out Cavern of Souls reprint 100%?"
" I have 2 commander decks. One is just an Aggro Kresh deck and very simple. The other has 2 commanders that I switch out on depending, using Morophon, or Golos and this is the deck ive been using lately. 

Now the problem people have with this deck is it’s entirely just a bunch of random infinite combos thrown into one deck and while the other 3 players are duking it out I’m just ramping and drawing till I have one of the few combos in the deck to win the game. And the other day I walked in and was by myself and nobody wanted to have me join there table as a 4th.

This one guy who kind of inspired me to build this deck cuz he had this really obnoxious deck I could never beat and he was a bit of a prick said that no ones gonna play with me if I keep bringing that deck lol.

Regardless I just thought it was funny to share and this is the deck list:

[golos/morophon combos deck]( I think I’ve irritated just about all the regulars at my local commander night to the point of refusing to play with me"
"I truly love the plane and normally I would be hyped for this set. But goddamn!!! So man set releases, so much hype, so much SL, so much random problems in the game, so much over powered problems, so many releases… it’s just too much! I never thought I would say it but, I truly hope Magic slows down releases because this is just making me numb and uninterested when I would normally be plenty hyped.

Anyone else just completely fatigued too? I love Innistrad, BUT I AM EXHAUSTED!"

"A quick update!  MaRo has gone on record for one of the clues; namely the “popular *Innistrad* reprint” [hasn’t been revealed yet!](  So there’s still the opportunity for something big to happen!

What will it be?  Let’s see what we currently have:

MaRo’s List:  

* three popular mechanics previously seen on Innistrad return ([Flashback]( [Transform]( [Investigate](
* [a new drawback for creature tokens that lets us create them cheaper (""Decayed"", it can't block and when it attacks it is sacrificed at end of combat)](
* a white card that could potentially draw you a card each turn
* a popular *Innistrad* card gets reprinted
* [a curse that transforms into a creature (Curse of Leeches, transforms into a Leech Horror at night and can reattach to a player during the day)](
* two permanents that can double something every turn ([Unnatural Growth, the P/T of your creatures until end of turn, triggers at start of each combat](
* [a mythic cycle with “you may pay [COST] any number of times” (the “Adversary” cycle features creatures that let you spend an extra cost repeatedly on cast; they enter with more counters the more you spend, and have an effect that scales with them)](
* [a four mana blue aura with “You control enchanted creature.” (Grafted Identity, you also have to sac a creature but the enchanted creature gets +1/+1)](
* [A popular tournament card in multiple formats gets reprinted with its fifth piece of art. (Pithing Needle)](
* [a character from Innistrad once mentioned in a short story finally gets a card in an Innistrad set (Liesa, Forgotten Archangel, first mentioned (not by name) in]( [“A Gaze Blank and Pitiless”](
* [""If your life total would be reduced to 0 or less,"" (Enduring Angel, instead transform Enduring Angel and your life total becomes 3; if Enduring Angel doesn’t transform this way you lose the game)](
* ""This spell costs 1 less to cast for each creature you attacked with this turn.""
* ""As [CARDNAME] enters the battlefield, note your life total.""
* [""put a slime counter on up to one other target creature."" (Sludge Monster, when it ETBs or attacks; non-Horror creatures with slime counters on them become 2/2s and lose their abilities)](
* [""Creature tokens you control lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 3/3."" (Poppet Factory, a blue artifact that transforms from a creature that makes Decayed Zombie tokens)](
* ""Each instant and sorcery card in your graveyard has""
* ""Instants and sorcery spells you cast cost X less to cast, where X is [CARDNAME]’s power.""
* [""put that many +1/+1 counters on [CARDNAME], then create twice that many 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens"" (Tainted Adversary, part of the Adversary cycle, so you get the counters from repaying the card's mana cost when casting it)](
* ""At the beginning of your end step, if you have exactly 13 life,""
* **[""You may cast any number of the copies without paying their mana costs."" (Bloodthirsty Adversary, the Red Adversary exiles instants and sorceries with mana value 3 or less from your graveyard and copies them)](
* Creature – Hippogriff Spirit
* [Creature – Human Soldier Werewolf (Brutal Cathar)](
* Creature – Dragon Egg
* [Creature – Leech Horror (Leeching Lurker)](
* Creature – Fungus Horror
* **[Creature – Plant Horror (“Rootvine Creeper”)](
* Creature – Drake Horror
* Creature – Demon Dog
* Legendary Creature – Ooze

"Hello, I'm the Deciphering Phyrexian guy

I'm making a video in which I use what I learned in particle physics to explain why it actually makes a lot of sense for there to be 5 kinds of mana in the MTG multiverse, spoiler: it can all be explained by a force obeying the SU(5) symmetry group, which is really interesting because scientists working on Grand Unification (a theory that explains all of nature with just one force) actually use SU(5) to make their theories

The problem is that I have no idea how to title it, what do you suggest me? I'm making a video applying particle physics to explain why there are 5 colors in MTG and how it could be related to Grand Unification, how should I title it?"

Was there ever a number crunch done or was it ever stated how many werewolves were going to be in this set? I’m curious how many they planned to inject into this set since there isn’t gonna be a commander deck. Also was a poll ever done to determine response to a possible errata for old werewolves?

"Personally my vote would go to ""wall"" because... well think about it. It's a wall, the most passive &amp; boring thing ever. It takes effort to mold it into some kind of world jumping god-being. 

I'm picturing a kind of bust/gargoyle that manifests in existing masonry when it planeswalks, which (in its native artificial plane) just takes the shape of an unbroken geometrically perfect wall folded in on itself infinite times in order to form a kind of tesseract labyrinth. 

Personality-wise... most paranoid home security buff ever? IE: it figured out other planeswalkers were a thing early on and just nuped out of the multiverse entire to build a glorified panic room/treasure trove.

Would make a neat basis for a heist themed block. Obscure creature type that would make the most interesting planeswalker?"
"Hello :D

The reprint of Pithing Needle has me wondering about the topic of a list of cards that would always be legal in standard.

Things like Pithing Needle or Relic for example (or in the same vein but less powerful), so as to always give universal sideboard answers to anything too broken the designers let slip past playtesting.

The list could be an ""emergency legalisation"" list too, for example if a graveyard deck is too powerful and wrecking the format, instead of banning the cards, they could add a card from the list to Standard.

I'm curious to hear everyone's take on the matter :) What's your opinion on an ""always Standard legal"" list of cards ?"
"I remember browsing through cardmarket.com the other day and looking for some card prices. I thought, I saw a card, which was or is on the Reserved List, but it had a version with the Falling Star symbol, which Secret Lair cards have.

I might be wrong, but I'm getting crazy here, not to find that card any more.

Is this even possible? Looking for a card: I think, it was on the Reserved List, but I saw it on MCM with a Secret Lair symbol?"

"So I bought my brother the Kaldheim commander deck with the Viking dude. I bought myself the Witherbloom Witchcraft commander deck.

I just can't help it but get aggressive every time we play, cause somehow he's able to spawn many tokens every round. His deck has so much synergy while mine is about to give my creature +1/+1 every time I get life.

All of his tokens are flying while my deck only has 2 flying creatures. I can heal myself pretty frequently, but he can always attack me directly. 

Despite him having 20 flying tokens on the field, he can upgrade all of them with +2/+2 or +1/+1 and attack me.

I just don't get why my deck has such a disadvantage against his deck.

We're pretty new to the game, so basically we've played 20 rounds in total. Maybe we don't understand the rules completely (watched a ton of YT videos) but I feel like his deck is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay stronger than mine.

Didn't even win once.

Is his deck a counter against mine?

It's not fun loosing every round against him, since we only have the 2 decks and I can't change cards. Kaldheim commander deck"

"Hi guys, gals and those who identify otherwise. I wanna gift my girlfriend the most beautiful card possible, we collect pokemon together and she is in it for the art. I want to get her into magic, not because I want her to buy packs and let me keep the ones she doesn't like xD 
Please gimme your thoughts on the most beautiful cards. 
I wanna work with a 100$ limit, but I'll appreciate anything. Most beautiful cards."
"Hello,

I last played EDH around 2015. I'm now returning and looking through my old decks. 

I'm wondering, is something like [[Gilded Lotus]], [[Mana Crypt]] or [[Lotus Bloom]] still played on EDH? I couldn't find much info on that.

Thanks in advance? Returning player: Are big mana rocks still played in EDH?"
I am new to the game and have stumbled across them. When they are ‘discarded’ do they become a mana card and essentially join my pool as a chosen land? Do they work for one turn only and then go to the graveyard? I cant find anyway a fundamental explanation as to how these dang things work! Please explain!!! Can someone please explain precisely how treasure tokens work?
"If you have an otherwise totally deterministic combo which allows you to loot infinite times and you have at least 1 card already in hand, in a  tournament setting are you allowed to commit to saying something like ""every time I loot I'm going to discard the card I draw"", and then shortcut the looting to putting an arbitrary number of cards from the top of your library into your graveyard? Or because the decision to discard the card you draw is technically not a commitment made in the actual game rules you can't do that? Shortcutting Infinite Looting"

"I recently found out that a \[\[Sliver Queen\]\] I purchased back in 2016 or so freaking skyrocketed in price, in part due to the fact that it's a reserved list card, and in part due to the fact that there were a ton of slivers printed relatively recently. I got it for $70 or so, back when I was flush with cash, wanted to build a sliver EDH deck, and didn't realize there were better Sliver commanders at the time. The reason it was relatively expensive was that it was signed by the artist.

How can I get about getting this appraised? I'm seeing Sliver Queen for about $200 damaged, and I'm not sure if it being signed by the artist counts as damaged.

"Alright. So for my deck that I play with friends. We play a format more closer to modern but it's basically a ""nothing is banned but no one really plays broken cards because curbstomping constantly is no fun"" I made a coin flip deck. Tavern Scoundrel is just amazing. It feels like I have infinite coins the entire game. So. Pretty simple idea. Turn 2 your going to tavern Scoundrel and turn 3 your going to do a couple of different things. 1. Game of chaos if your looking for a cheeky kill. 2. Just a simple Krarks thumb. 3. Fiery gambit. Any 3 of these will skyrocket you. So what I normally do is turn 2 krark then turn 3 I'll cast a fiery gambit so I most likely can also turn 3 in tavern Scoundrel. Then all I do is cast Stitch in time for the extra turn. End turn. Go into krark the thumbless. It makes it so all instant and sorcery's I'm looking at extra mana! Not only that 2 mana for a 1/3 that makes a ton of mana is worth it imo. Wish I saw more coinflip content on yt. Imo. Coin flip is underrated."
"Does anyone know of some sort of special protective case or some sort of frame that can be purchased online, specifically meant for protecting and showcasing a very special magic card? I’m looking to protect a very special card."
I remember seeing a website that did this but all the ones I have checked seem to require looking up the card individually or the whole set. Could someone please point me to a website that lists the price of each card in a preconstruced Wizard's deck where you can search by deck. Thankyou for your help. Website which lists price of individual cards of preconstructed decks
I was researching some late '90s Magic memorabilia and I came across some promotional poker decks that I had never seen before. The most interesting designs appear to be from 1998 but I can't find a full scan of the cards anywhere online. When I looked on Magic libraries I found that [many of the cards are totally missing scans]( Would anyone who has both of these decks consider scanning the missing cards so future generations (and I) can get a closer look at the cards? If the number cards are half as cool as the face cards I may even consider buying a deck secondhand. Thanks in advance! Who Can Help Complete the Wizards of the Coast Poker Decks Cards

"Hello, I have a question regarding MTG lore. I’ve always loved MTG since I was a child but never really cared too much about the lore back then. It were just cool looking cards I played with. 

I recently came back and started playing arena. Strixhaven and AFR didn’t really catch me, but the new Innistrad set looks amazing and really well themed. I also liked the articles WOTC posts from time to time for the set. 

So I wondered what’s a good way to get deeper into the lore of MTG, maybe even especially Innistrad? Although I find Ravnica, Theros and Kaldheim also very interesting thematically wise. 
Are there recommendable books out there? And what’s a good starting point (chronologically)? I think starting at the very first beginning might be a bit too much to catch up. 

Thank you in advance! How to get into the lore of MTG and what books are there herefore?"

Blogatog posted that he saw Kaya on the Preview Card. Can you tell me which card it appeared on? Did you see Kaya on the Preview Card?"

"Surveil is basically used in ever set, but worded without using the keyword. No reason really not to do it other then maybe being hesitant because it’s a ravnica thing with dimir? Surveil needs to be an evergreen mechanic"
"Is there books I should order on Amazon, a wiki I should read, a movie to watch? I started playing Arena a week before AFR released and have been obsessed since. I actually ended up ordering all 5 Core 2021 decks to teach my SO and nephew how to play and just preordered a box on Amazon for the werewolf set. 

I only played casually as a teenager in the early 2000s and know nothing of the lore expect the player is a planeswalker. I just watched the werewolf set premiere stream on the MTG YouTube account and the way they talked about the planes and everything made it clear I have no idea what is going on.

I would read a wiki but also love reading books, any suggestions on how to get up to date is really appreciated. For someone getting into MTG, thanks to Arena, where or how can I learn the lore? Books?"
"What if a new format was introduced that only utilized cards from standard legal sets printed between 8th Edition and Born of the Gods? Basically, card printed with the border used after 8th Edition, but before the slight border change implemented in M15. Format Idea"
"I’m curious, what’s the average price people are paying for packs and boxes? 
I went into my LGS and asked about a box of Jumpstart. It was $150. A quick glance at Amazon lists it for $100 and some change. Is this common? A 50% markup seems high but I haven’t been playing for too long so I don’t know what’s expected. 

I want to support my LGS but $50 is halfway to another box. I mostly buy singles, but for Jumpstart or even a box for Draft, I can see a reason to buy the whole thing. How much does your Local Game Store mark up their prices?"
"So, what are the canonical rules on this one? I realize the rules on literally anything relating to sparks are vague at best, but I'm curious.

What do you think? I kinda I find the innistrad mythics a bit boring for now
"After the Great Mending occurred when Jeska sealed the final time rift on Dominaria, planeswalkers became significantly weaker in many aspects.

One of the effects is planeswalkers can no longer bring organic matter through the Blind Eternities.

So how are we in game (as planeswalkers) able to summon creatures? Is this a plot hole or am I missing something? Lore question"
"The one a set post, where is still to early to tell if the set is overpowered or underpowered. Obligatory DAE Think this set under powered?"
 I have about 40 Card Kingdom Battle Decks so fae that I want to sleeve up and put into deck boxes to store. Does anyone have any suggestions for clear/blank cardboard deck boxes? I've looked at a few bulk box retailers and nobody seems to have boxes in the size needed. Inexpensive Deck Box Suggestions
So I play Dino Tribal in EDH using Gishath Sun's Avatar as my commander. Usually my will con is flood the board with dinosaurs and win by attack or use an enrage combo I have if the cards are right. However I'm looking for other potential win cons. Doors anyone have any cheap RWG/Naya win cons to add into my deck? Deck win cons
"Building a new commander deck and ordering off TCG is cheaper for me then purchasing the deck list from my local stores, want to know others thoughts and experiences on TCG. How long did they take? Were the cards in the condition stated, etc

Also anyone that may have ordered outside of US did any extra charges apply? Thoughts on TCGplayer?"
"Hi! I’m making an Ixalan cube, and I want to include cards that take place thematically on Ixalan even if they are not from Ixalan/Rivals; for example, Breeches from Commander legends. I’d rather not go through every card in all the supplemental and core sets that have come out in the past several years looking for them, and I’m wondering if there is any shortcut to finding all the cards themed around a single plane. Here’s what I’m hoping to find:

1. Preferably, a link to a list of all the Ixalan-themed cards printed since Ixalan/Rivals.
2. If not that, I’d love to hear some strategies y’all would recommend to create my own list.
3. If not that, I wouldn’t say no to comments with whatever card comes to mind that fits the bill.

Thanks in advance, y’all! Non-Ixalan Ixalan"

"Hello, I’m a relatively new player looking for places to purchase cards, a play mat, card sleeves and maybe a few other things. Uk based stuff would be appreciated but anything will do. I’m mainly looking for somewhere to buy individual cards the most and then sleeves and a play mat come after that in priority.

Thanks MTG kit"
"New to MTG, still trying to grasp certain concepts.

I am looking at playing \[\[Nivmagus Elemental\]\], but i don't understand how to activate the ability here. To exile a sorcery or instant I control, it would have to be in play. So how do you exile an instant? Cast it then declare you'd like to exile it instead? How to exile instant you ""control"" ???"

"My main reason for quitting was my displeasure with the constant bans, been watching from the outside with the Masters Sets and Secret Lair happenings, but I do miss the game. 

Too early to tell, I'm guessing, but wondering what the mood is regarding standard. I quit during Eldraine. Now that it is rotating, is Standard looking like it is worth coming back to?"
What are cards like forgotten ancient and managorger hydra? I have looked and don't really know what to search. Spell buff cards
"Hello. Is there any good method to fix cards clicking issue? Clicking occurs when you push middle of the card either from top or bottom and it makes that click sound sometimes locking the card in the position you push in. It is very annoying, especially if you have big stack of cards and they all are making that noisy click sound. Is that the temperature/humidity thing or something else? Cards ""clicking"" problem"
